    <p>Flurries of snow fell upon the quiet town of Numazu, sticking to the ground and turning the landscape a pristine white. Bundled up in her favorite black coat, Dia stepped out of her car and headed up the walkway to her family home. A gust of wind swept across the yard, blowing her hair all over her face. Huffing crossly, she brushed it out of her eyes, barely able to keep herself from sprinting to the door in order to get inside. That would be uncouth for someone like her, though. Instead, she paced herself properly, pulling out her keys to unlock the door and step inside. A sigh of relief escaped her lips as she was engulfed in the warmth of the Kurosawa household.</p><p>The sound of the door closing shut was ample enough to reverberate through the foyer, all the way to the bedrooms, where Ruby was hard at work studying. Hearing the sound, she stole a sidelong glance at her calendar, just so that her heart wouldn't be crushed if it meant anything other than what she desperately hoped it meant. But there was the date, with the beginning of Dia's winter break circled in pink highlighter and dotted with hearts. Hastily, she marked her spot in her textbook and stepped outside into the hallway, only stopping to smooth the wrinkles in her skirt and run her fingers through her pigtails. She wanted to look her best as she raced forth to wrap her sister in a hug, shouting <em>"Onee-chan!"</em> all the while.</p><p>Dia had just finished locking the door when that red blur ran right into her, enveloping her tightly. Letting out a <em>“pigyi!”</em> of surprise, it didn't take long to realize who the culprit was. Honestly, you'd think that she'd be familiar with this happening whenever she came home, but she was still so easily caught off guard.</p><p>"Ruby!" Dia shouted. Her surprise quickly melted into a happy smile as she hugged her younger sister back, holding her tight. "I missed you, Ruby. How have you been? Everything going alright at school?"</p><p>"It's- it's been going okay," Ruby sputtered out aimlessly. She was much more focused on Dia's warmth, how wonderful it felt to have her sister pressed close against her. Realizing that she should be a good little sister, though, she let go with a quiet whimper of disappointment, if only to help Dia take her coat off. "I'm doing well, but... I miss having you here to help me," she added quietly. Tears pricked at her eyes. "I missed you so much..."</p><p>"I missed you too, Ruby."</p><p>Dia allowed Ruby to help remove her coat, smiling throughout their ritual. She didn't recognize any of the signs of her sister's disappointment, nor was she looking for any. She was just relieved to be home, and happy to be in familiar surroundings. That didn't mean she was ungrateful: nothing could be further from the truth! Being away from the life she had known while at university made her appreciate those things and those people that much more. That went double for her sister.</p><p>"I'm going to go drop my bag off in my room, okay?"</p><p>"Oh! Um..." Ruby looked down at the ground, as if the tile were the most interesting thing in the world. She couldn’t bear the thought of Dia being out of her sight for even a second so soon after she’d gotten home, so she said the first thing that popped into her head. "Could I carry it for you?" The words came out as little more than a mutter, but soon Ruby willed herself to look Dia directly in the eyes, the emerald green a reflection of her own. "You must be really tired after your trip, Onee-chan. I want to take care of everything for you, okay?"</p><p>"Huh?" Again, Dia was caught off guard. It didn't take long for her to agree, though, smiling warmly at her sister. "Of course. I appreciate it, Ruby. I'll meet you in the kitchen, alright?" Handing her back to Ruby, Dia absconded for the kitchen. Her drive home had made her hungry, and she needed a snack to tide her over until dinner with her family.</p><p>Ruby frowned as Dia walked away, leaving her standing alone in the foyer. That wasn’t how her request was supposed to turn out, and all she could do was pout. Maybe it was wrong of her to feel jealous of nothing more than a snack, but she couldn't help herself. It didn’t matter if they were apart for even a second; it was the principle of the matter, not the length of the time. How could Dia leave her alone so soon after returning? Her place was by Dia’s side, after all, hanging off her arm if she could help it.</p><p>With a childish huff, she lugged Dia's bag into her room, setting it down and surveying the barren walls. At the very least, she figured, she might as well unpack for Dia while she was here. That in mind, she set about removing everything and hanging it up, blouses and skirts and underwear all neatly folded or hung in the closet. Before initially thinking she’d finished, however, Ruby found one last outfit tucked away at the bottom of the bag almost as if it were meant to be out of sight. With her brows furled, she pulled it out and gasped - it was a sheer blouse and short short combo, the top frilly and pink. Along with it came a translucent bralette that matched the blouse, trimmed with flowery lace, and Ruby found herself blushing at an adventurous side of Dia she never even knew existed.</p><p>Suddenly, a thought popped into her head, one entirely unlike her; she should wear it. Surely her sister would be mad, but... Ruby wanted to get Dia’s attention. She didn’t just want to be Dia’s little sister, the kind that could be easily ignored; she wanted to be <em>seen.</em> Grasping the bundle of fabrics like they were state secrets, Ruby slipped away to her room to change. Tucked away in the back of her closet, she had one last item that would complete the outfit.</p><p>Meanwhile Dia stood in the kitchen, reveling in some pudding as she relaxed and waited for Ruby to return. She was truly an innocent lady, nevermind that less-than-innocent underwear she may or may not have had stashed away. Not that she realized that had been discovered... yet. Her ears perked up at quiet footsteps from behind her, knowing that Ruby had come to join her.</p><p>"So, Ruby, how-" She turned around, and the words died in her throat. The spoonful of pudding she held froze in place, her hand halfway towards her mouth. Eyes wide, she stared at Ruby standing there in clothes that she knew all too well.</p><p>The warmth flooding her cheeks let her know that she was blushing something fierce. That outfit was too... too hot for Ruby to be wearing. Of course, it had been in Dia’s bag, but... no, that wasn't the point! Had it never occurred to Ruby just how sheer that blouse was? Dia could see her bralette underneath it, hinting at a part of her body that she was never supposed to see. </p><p>"R-Ruby? A-Are you wearing my clothes?" she stammered, sounding stupider than she would have liked.</p><p>Ruby giggled and blushed, doing her best to look as innocent as possible. She'd grown up since Dia last lived at home, but even still, she couldn't quite figure out what had come over her as she stood there, moving about so that Dia could take in the sight of the all-too-revealing outfit.</p><p>"W- well, I was going to put away your clothes for you," she explained. "But then I saw this, and it looks so cute, Onee-chan! Remember when we used to make idol outfits and model them for each other?" Her voice was saccharine sweet, and she hoped it had an effect on Dia, even after all these years.</p><p>Dia swallowed thickly, her eyes drawn to every inch of her younger sister as she twirled around like a little fashionista. Shamefully, so utterly shamefully, the thought crossed her mind that Ruby's butt looked good in those short shorts. It was (likely) inevitable that she would grow into a more feminine woman. That cutesy, childish look of hers was bound to mature with age, and Ruby was eighteen already. It was just that this was her <em>sister</em> that she was talking about. In her mind, Ruby was still the little crybaby in pigtails who’d always trailed after her like a lost puppy. Seeing her sweet, innocent Ruby twirling around with her bra visible was too much for Dia’s poor brain to comprehend.</p><p>"Y-Yes, I... I do remember that," she murmured, almost completely dazed by what was happening. Of course, when they’d modeled idol outfits for each other, none of them had been so <em>risque</em>. She had never felt anything close to what she was feeling now back then. No more words would come out of her mouth. All she could do was nod stupidly with red splotched on her cheeks as Ruby stepped closer, now just a short distance away from Dia.</p><p>Even though she didn't have much to work with, Ruby found herself subtly adjusting her gait so that her breasts were pushed out. She couldn’t quite rationalize the way she was manipulating her body; it just felt <em>right </em>to be doing this, so much so that she couldn’t bring herself to back down. "Do you think this looks cute on me, Onee-chan? I bet it looks even better on you," she concluded with an inflection that just hinted at a tease. "You always were so beautiful in anything."</p><p>Now swallowing, even thickly, was near impossible, as Dia's mouth had gone completely dry. Ruby was standing way too close to her, acting so... so provocative. There was no other word that could describe it. The way she was acting was something Dia expected from <em>Mari</em>, not from her innocent sister.</p><p>"Well, what... what do you expect?" she muttered, wishing that she didn't appear as out of sorts as she knew she did. "I always rock such outfits." Her normal confidence sounded forced with the way her voice shook. For goodness’ sake, she couldn't stop staring at her sister's breasts! They weren't anything special, but then again, puberty hadn't been kind to her either - neither of them were destined to compare with their friends, at any rate. "But, yes, you... you look very cute in that outfit. Sexy, even." Wait, what? Had she just said Ruby looked sexy in her outfit? What was wrong with her?!</p><p>As Dia fretted about the words she had just spoken, Ruby was turning them over in her mind. She knew that they weren’t okay, but… she had never been told that before. She had never thought of herself as <em>sexy</em>, but coming from the person whose view mattered to her more than anyone else’s, the word only made her heart beat faster as her body began to act with a mind of its own. A giggle flittered about in the air as Ruby stepped just ever so slightly closer, just to see how far inside Dia's personal space she could get.</p><p>"You really think I'm sexy?~" she crooned. "It's been a really long time since you've been home, Onee-chan. I grew up a lot. And, well... so did you. I want to catch up with my Onee-chan, and find out what she was doing in these kinds of outfits." A hand coyly snaked its way into Dia's, threading their fingers together as she looked up with bright, innocent eyes.</p><p>Dia paled noticeably, her hand unconsciously squeezing Ruby's. "I..." What had happened to her confidence? She had never felt this speechless around her sister before. If Ruby had really matured so much, did that mean she was gaining an advantage that she hadn’t had before?</p><p>"I would never do whatever you might be implying," Dia finally responded, but it sounded weak. How could Ruby look so innocent when what she was saying was anything but?</p><p>"Oh," Ruby replied, lacing dejection into the sound. "I hoped you had some fun stories to tell. Maybe... we could make some?"</p><p>Ruby looked down, and felt her breath hitch when she saw a bulge forming in Dia's pants. She couldn't grasp exactly what she was doing, not when a flurry of emotions was clouding her brain and fogging her judgement. She had missed Dia so much, and the thought that her precious Onee-chan would ignore her for even a single second was so abhorrent as to morph that longing into something possessive and much less platonic.</p><p>Now, seeing the evidence of Dia’s arousal, Ruby’s feelings were only amplified as her thoughts drifted to Dia's college life. Had Dia been doing anything? Was there... a boyfriend? A girlfriend? The thought made Ruby’s eyes well up. Onee-chan was <em>hers</em>, and she didn't want anyone to take Dia away.</p><p>"Mom and Dad aren't home," she whispered, letting the implications linger in the air uneasily.</p><p>"They... aren't?" Die asked in reply. Was it hot in the kitchen all of a sudden? Someone needed to turn the thermostat down. Maybe she needed to. She looked down at Ruby, whose expression carried so many emotions that Dia wasn't sure which one to focus on. None of them could distract from her erection, though, and her face started heating up as she tried to subtly adjust herself. "Ruby, just... just what exactly are you implying?" She ran her tongue across her lips, trying to get some moisture going. Why was she getting hard in front of her little sister? This wasn't right! ... Why did that make her harder?</p><p>"Nothing," Ruby replied sweetly. "Just... your trip must have been long, and you just got home. I bet you're so stressed, Onee-chan. I just want to spend some time with you and help you relax."</p><p>"It... was a long trip," Dia murmured, unable to disagree with that sentiment. It was always nice to have some way to relax after a long drive, even if that wasn’t going how she’d intended it to.</p><p>In response to the sentiment, Ruby let go of Dia's hand, but instead of letting them entirely part she chose to grab Dia's wrist instead, leading her hand to the top Ruby was wearing. She guided it all across the fabric, letting Dia's hand roam her barely-covered skin, inching closer and closer to her breasts, to the point of no return that she found herself skirting so brazenly.</p><p>"What did you buy this top for, Onee-chan? Were you trying to make someone notice you?" She looked up with innocent eyes, waiting to see what Dia would say.</p><p>Dia sucked in a breath when she saw her fingers were going, where Ruby was guiding them. "N-No, of course not!" She did her usual deal of denying things, her face turning red as she actually let the truth out. "I... I wanted to feel sexy."</p><p>"You've always been sexy to me," Ruby replied softly, so soft that some part of her hoped it could be passed off as a stray noise. She meant it, though, and her confession was out in the open now. "Everything about you just... makes me feel so weak..." Taking the plunge, she finally pulled Dia's hand to one of her breasts. All that separated her older sister from her breast was just two thin, sheer strips of fabric. It was so wrong, but all she knew was that she wanted this, to be <em>Dia’s.</em></p><p>"D- do you want this, Onee-chan? Do you want me?"</p><p>"Ruby..." Dia made a noise somewhere between a gasp and a whimper. She could scarcely believe where her hand was, but she made no attempt to remove it. For several moments, they both stood there silently, Dia's hand on Ruby's breast and her sister's request hanging in the air. Dia was sure her heart was about to beat right out of her chest. Then, before her brain could react properly, she wrapped her arm around Ruby's back and pulled her close. As soon as their bodies were pressed against each other, she kissed her. She was kissing her little sister, she was groping her little sister's breasts, and she wasn't even trying to stop herself.</p><p>"Look what you've done to me," she panted against Ruby's lips, getting her words out in between their stopgap kisses. "This is wrong, Ruby, and I can't stop myself..." As if it were Ruby's fault that she had given in to this unholy desire.</p><p>As soon as their lips connected, Ruby melted into Dia, taking the chance to finally wrap her arms around her sister's body, to get as close as possible. As her small breasts were felt up and harshly groped, she moaned shamelessly for Dia to hear. Her Onee-chan was home, finally, and they were together - now Ruby could show just how much Dia meant to her. As soon as their lips broke off for a split second to catch some breath, Ruby finally spoke.</p><p>"Onee-chan, I'm so wet," she mewled. "I want you so badly...." A hand reached between them, slowly venturing lower and lower until finally her fingertips fulfilled a promise, brushing up against the bulge in Dia’s pants.</p><p>They had already crossed the threshold, but now it had been thoroughly smashed, and it sent Dia reeling. Though she had gone on the offensive, her body had done so without her consent. Now it froze up as Ruby's hand made its presence known, rubbing on Dia’s erection. She started to blush, knowing that Ruby was getting to feel just how hard she was. Her <em>little sister</em> knew that she was hard for her. It was mortifying, yet strangely gratifying.</p><p>"Let me... Let me feel how wet you are," Dia whispered, taking in every inch of Ruby that she could. "Show me how badly you want me." She couldn't believe she was speaking so forcefully, but it felt strangely natural, like she was meant to talk like that.</p><p>The way Dia's voice took on its authoritative tone only made Ruby's heat worse, and she was afraid she'd soak Dia's short shorts straight through. Wordlessly, she took a small step back, fiddling with the button and zipper until they were both undone, and guided Dia's hand shakily into her shorts, letting her feel the soaking wet lace underneath. As soon as Dia's hand passed over her clit, she whimpered, her face scrunched up.</p><p>"I- I-" she tried to say as she tripped over her words, the lust clouding her mind. "I love when you talk like that, Onee-chan..."</p><p>Upon hearing those words, Dia’s heart felt like it was both beating way too fast, yet also not beating at all. She couldn't believe how wet Ruby was: she was soaked! Was this all because of her? She passed over Ruby's clit, feeling the scintillating fabric of lace beneath her skin as her hand moved.</p><p>"When did you get this underwear, Ruby?" She was surprised: she had never imagined Ruby to wear something so scandalous. Things really <em>had</em> changed while she was gone.</p><p>"I- mmn," Ruby moaned, her whimpers becoming increasingly brazen as Dia massaged her labia slowly. "I... asked Kanan to help me pick them out." Ruby hooked her thumbs on the waistband of her shorts and tugged downward, letting them crumple limply to the floor to reveal the pink lace of the thong, which rode up her hips and left little to the imagination about what lay underneath. "When I tried them on the first time, I was scared, but she encouraged me. She told me that I deserved to look sexy. Do they make you want to do things to me?"</p><p>Dia really wanted to let out several choice swears, but her restraint held her back, if only in this one case. Even as she soaked in Ruby’s body, it still felt wrong to be cursing in front of her, cognitive dissonance be damned.</p><p>"They... they do," she whispered, though her throbbing erection told more than her words ever could. She couldn't stop staring at Ruby in that tiny pink thong, and the sight left her so hard that it hurt. "I don't know whether to thank Kanan or kill her for this."</p><p>Ruby giggled, and she stood up on her toes to kiss Dia once again, taking longer to savor the feeling of those soft lips brushing up against her own. "You can always thank me instead," she crooned in little more than a whisper. "What do you want to do with me, Onee-chan? We have to make up for lost time, after all."</p><p>"Thank you..." Dia kissed her back, sighing against her lips. "If we have time to make up, then we should do it in my bedroom." She pulled herself away from Ruby, taking her hand and leading her towards the bedroom, the shorts left to lie on the kitchen floor.</p><p>Ruby’s heart nearly thumped straight out of her chest as she was led along, Dia’s grip on Ruby's hand firm enough to send wonderful shivers through her body. With Dia taking a more assured role, Ruby found some of that alien confidence melting away now that it was no longer needed.</p><p>"Um... Onee-chan? Could you... have me on my bed? I'd really like that..."</p><p>"Your bed?" Dia stopped, pondering the thought for a moment. Then she nodded, changing course to lead them to Ruby's bedroom. "Yes, come on then." Confidence wasn't foreign to her, but what they were doing was. She wasn't an assertive bedroom presence, and certainly not with her damn sister. Ruby being a teasing little minx worthy of Mari had triggered some sort of response inside her, though. She wanted to do this now. Her hard, throbbing erection was guiding her now, not her brain.</p><p>They stepped inside, and as Dia shut the door gently behind them, Ruby moved to the bed and swept a few stray plushies off of it. She wasn't sure what possessed her to suggest this, but there was something about being taken in her own bedroom, among all the evidence of an innocence she'd been so quick to discard, that was wonderful to her addled mind.</p><p>Even Dia felt a sense of hesitance as she saw all the normal fodder that made up her sister's room. Everything was still as pretty and pink as it had been for years, giving rise to a churning of guilt in her stomach. Was she really about to defile her sister's innocence in her childhood bedroom? She approached Ruby, who moved her hands to Dia's pants.</p><p>"It must hurt, Onee-chan. I'm going to take it out now, okay?"</p><p>Even with the doubts waging war in her mind, it was hard to feel anything but the arousal that had been blooming within her when Ruby spoke.</p><p>"It does hurt," Dia muttered, taking a deep breath as horny confidence overtook her. "It hurts, and it's your fault for making me feel this way. Please take care of it right away."</p><p>Ruby's breath hitched as the words left Dia's mouth, and she hastily fumbled with Dia's fly until it finally fell undone, allowing her to pull it down and bear witness to Dia's erection, tenting the fabric of her panties. Even the veins of her cock were on full display, so tight was the fit, and Ruby was nearly drooling as she looked down at it. It was Dia's cock, her <em>big sister's</em> cock, and it was hard because of what Ruby had done. Absentmindedly, her thighs rubbed together, anything to relieve the ache in her core as she imagined it filling her up.</p><p>"I'm so sorry, Onee-chan," she replied dutifully. "I'll- I'll make it all better, like a good sister should." Without even thinking, she dropped down to her knees on the carpet, freeing Dia's cock from its constraints and placing a gentle, delicate kiss on its tip. Before she could focus on her own arousal, she had to make Dia feel better. That was what mattered.</p><p>A small moan escaped Dia’s throat, her cock still throbbing painfully. The sight was hard to fathom as she watched from above, breath weak and shaky. Ruby was down on her knees, doting on her cock because she had told her too. How could she have done that? But... it felt too good to really worry about that. She needed relief, no matter what - or who - gave it to her. It was perfectly alright if Ruby was the one to do it. No, it was<em> better</em> if it was her.</p><p>Suddenly Dia found herself insecure, however. "I'm sorry for... for how I must appear," she murmured, a light blush crossing her face as she stared down at her own cock. An above-average eight inches, it throbbed like mad in front of Ruby's lips. "I know it's not very... very sexy..." The truth was in the clothes Ruby was wearing, the ones Dia had bought in a sudden rash of confidence one day; she’d wanted to feel sexy. Now, though, the way her cock was too big to even fit in her panties made her feel unattractive.</p><p>Ruby's answer was the way her lips parted, though, the way they took the head of Dia's cock between them. Her hands reached for its base to slowly stroke its substantial length, moving back and forth in soothing motions as another hand idly played with Dia's balls. She had never watched much porn, always scared of what Dia would think - a thought that now seemed only ironic - but somehow it all came to her so naturally. She was a good sister, and taking care of her Onee-chan was in her nature.</p><p>When her lips left Dia, a silvery strand of saliva connecting them, she looked up with warmth in her eyes. "You look so incredible, Onee-chan. You turn me on so much," she replied, her hand still stroking Dia's length. "You're so beautiful and feminine, but... I think I love your cock most of all." She returned her lips to it, slowly working herself farther and farther down Dia's shaft.</p><p>"You... you do?"</p><p>Dia couldn't keep the moans inside anymore, not as Ruby took her cock like that. Throbbing within the safety of her sister's warm mouth, she felt her body begin to shake. It wasn't much, but it was noticeable, especially once Ruby began to fondle her balls. They were the most sensitive part of her body, and Ruby was getting to experience that firsthand. Dia blushed, her face heated with more than just embarrassment as she watched her little sister take more and more of her cock.</p><p>She had no clue where Ruby had learned how to do something like that, but as Ruby's movements gained more and more confidence, she found herself unable to worry or even to hide the truth: she was turned on, and Ruby was the one turning her on. She had her cock out and shoved down her sister's throat, and she liked it being there.</p><p>Dia's cock slid further and further back in Ruby’s throat, and soon Ruby could taste Dia's precum leaking out, the salty taste serving as encouragement for her to be more enthusiastic. She looked up at Dia, eyes wide and demure as she continued servicing her sister. She wanted nothing in the world more than for Dia to feel good, and the blush on Dia's face was proof enough to fill her with a sisterly kind of pride. A hand even snaked down to her panties, pulling them aside to slide two fingers inside, gathering her slick and bringing it to Dia's cock to use as a lube as she stroked Dia's shaft more.</p><p>Now, Dia couldn’t help but feel that this was starting to feel<em> too</em> good. She had a sudden worry that she was going to bust too quickly, and there was supposedly a lot of time for them to make up.</p><p>"Stop," she commanded, grabbing Ruby's pigtails and tugging upwards on them. "Let's... let's not get too carried away. I want to..." She felt her face heating up again. What she wanted to say was so embarrassing, and wrong, and... and so fucking hot. "I want to fuck you, Ruby. I want to fuck your wet pussy, because I'm the one who made it wet." With Ruby's lips off her cock, she stepped back and started to undo the buttons on her blouse. "Take off your clothes for me."</p><p>The act of having her pigtails pulled like that was enough to ruin the last ounce of Ruby's patience to have Dia inside of her, so the order came as a blissful reprieve, though some strange pang of disappointment nagged at her now that she wasn’t sucking Dia’s cock.</p><p>"Y- yes, Onee-chan. You made my pussy wet." Obediently, she slid off her panties, a process made all the more difficult by how wet they were and how tightly they fit on her body. The fabric clung to her skin until finally it was off, tossed aside onto the floor with a quiet <em>plop</em>. Next came the blouse, which she tugged off just as Dia was finished unbuttoning and removing her own top. Ruby took a moment to stare lovingly at Dia's body, admiring the elegant bra she had on, before removing Dia's bralette from her own body.</p><p>Now that Ruby stood there, naked, vulnerable, and ready to be taken, it took every ounce of Dia's self-control to not jump her right then and there. Her hands were shaking as she unhooked her bra from behind and let it fall from her body. Finally the two sisters stood naked together, in a room so full of innocence. Ruby’s plushies didn't need to see what Dia was about to do to their owner, and even Ruby couldn’t help but mouth a silent <em>‘I’m sorry’ </em>to Mr. Fluffikins, who stood watch over her sanctity from the corner of the nightstand.</p><p>Still, none of that was about to stop them, not now. In a flash, Dia crossed the small distance she had put between them, latching onto her sister and kissing her with every ounce of strength she had. Her hands explored every inch of Ruby's body, eliciting quiet gasps with every touch and sudden movement. They had taken baths together, but it had never been like this. It had never felt inappropriate, or hot. Her cock throbbed up and down, smacking against Ruby's quivering, tiny thigh, seemingly big enough that it might tear up her poor little pussy. At that point, though, Dia couldn’t even care. Ruby had made her horny, and Ruby was going to take care of her.</p><p>To prove the point, Dia reached for Ruby’s ass and palmed it harshly, prompting Ruby to squeak and melt further into the kiss. She parted her lips as if purely by instinct, allowing Dia's tongue to slip between them. The feeling of Dia’s cock was too much for her, and the heat that it radiated only served to make her more and more desperate for her sister's touch.</p><p>"Onee-chan... please fuck me,” she begged into Dia's lips. "Please fuck Ruby's slutty pussy. Make me apologize for doing this to you, I can't take it anymore..."</p><p>Instead of answering, Dia just growled: an animalistic sound that bored deep into Ruby's ears. Reluctant as she was to stop grabbing Ruby's ass, she did so in order to push her sister onto the bed. Lording over Ruby with her cock pointed right at her sister, she continued her commands.</p><p>"Lay on your back, Ruby. Spread your legs and let me see your cunt." She was too far gone now to think about what she was saying. Even though it was uncharacteristically harsh, enough to leave Ruby weak and trembling, it was just what felt right. All Dia knew was that she was going to do what felt right: in this case, Ruby.</p><p>And in turn, Ruby basked in Dia’s unwavering attention, something that she craved even more now that it was so unquestioningly <em>dominant</em>. Without even thinking of disobeying Dia’s command, she leaned backwards and splayed herself across the bed, spreading her legs wide so that her sister had a full view of her pussy and the stained sheets beneath it.</p><p>Dia walked to the edge of the bed, staring between Ruby's legs and licking her lips. Now, Ruby’s brazen arousal was on full display, and a rush of emotions surged in Dia’s brain. It was such a slutty thing to do, staining the bed like that. Her sister was <em>slutty</em>. Narrowing her eyes, she hoisted herself onto the mattress, her cock throbbing between her legs and bouncing against her thighs as she crawled to her sister.</p><p>"Hanging around Kanan has been bad for you," she snarled, suddenly pouncing Ruby. Her palms pressed flat against the sheets, boxing Ruby's head in between them. Her eyes bored down into Ruby’s, showing that there was no nice, doting older sister there anymore. She was horny, and she was mad. "You've become such a slut. Just look at yourself." She dragged her cock along Ruby's wet slit, letting it flick a couple beads of juices down her stomach. "I'm going to have to show you how I feel about sluts."</p><p>Ruby whimpered and mewled, so scared and so aroused by the dominant energy that had possessed her sister. She grinded shamelessly against Dia's thick cock, not even considering that she was only confirming Dia's views - all she could think of was Dia inside of her.</p><p>"I'm- I'm so sorry, Onee-chan," she cried out pathetically. Tears pricked at her eyes, both from the shame and the arousal, but she never stopped grinding, never stopped desperately praying that Dia would up and take her. She was like a madwoman, possessed by how beautiful her sister looked when she was angry. "I let you down... please punish me for being a bad, slutty little sister, Onee-chan. Please use your cock to make me into a good girl again!"</p><p>There was a moment's hesitation on Dia's part, seeing the tears forming in Ruby's eyes. Then she felt the grinding against her cock, and the words coming out of her sister's mouth. Narrowing her eyes further, Dia got on her knees to keep herself balanced, then plunged her cock inside Ruby. There was no gentleness to her actions, or other foreplay to make her ready. Not that Ruby needed to be, however. Dia’s girth was hard to take, but Ruby had become so wet and aroused that it only felt natural to be stretched wide open the way she had been.</p><p>Dia's cock moved with ease, and the pain quickly turned into an indescribable pleasure and heat that moved throughout Ruby’s whole body. Her sister was home, and they were together again. She had no need to be jealous when Dia was here, in her room, breeding Ruby like there was no tomorrow.</p><p>"Onee-chan!" Ruby cried out. "Fuck me, Onee-chan! I need you to make me a good girl!" She wrapped her arms around Dia's neck, and brought them together for a long, slow kiss.</p><p>Dia kissed her back in turn, allowing herself to be drawn down against her sister's needy lips. Dia felt a strong need burning deep inside her core as well, one that she had never acknowledged before. She hadn’t even known it existed, but it was there all the same. It was obvious just what the truth was: she liked fucking her sister; taking control of her. Ruby was so easy and willing, just lying there naked and allowing herself to be taken without any resistance. </p><p>Eyes closed, Dia kissed Ruby with fervent passion, letting out the occasional pant or growl as she slammed her hips down repeatedly. She would lift herself up, then down again, quickly speeding the pace up as she fucked her little sister down into the bedsheets. No longer would Ruby be without someone to show her how to behave - come hell or high water, Dia would make Ruby into the best girl she could be.</p><p>With her missive in mind, Dia's movements grew almost animalistic in their urgency. Ruby mewled and whimpered as Dia's cock impaled her over and over, and eventually those small sounds grew and grew into a chorus of moans as she cried out for her sister. Dia was right: Ruby had become a slut, and it was apparent with every plea for more that escaped her lips. Her legs wrapped themselves around Dia, holding her tight. At least she was here now to make everything better - Ruby loved her sister dearly for that, and she didn't try to hide it. Her love was the way she pressed her lips tightly against Dia's, how she withstood Dia’s passion. Dia's attention was hers, and she wouldn't give it up for anything.</p><p>In the haze of lust that had settled around their sisterly union, Dia began to do things she should have known better than to do. She forcibly removed her lips from Ruby's, instead pressing them against her neck. She bit down and licked the supple skin, leaving hickies and bite marks all over. Ruby gasped as she felt Dia's mouth on her neck, and the pain caused tears to well up.</p><p>The marks would be hard to hide, but Dia wasn't in any right state of mind to linger on that. It was hard to be smart when her instincts told her to let her cock do the thinking. Even some small part of Ruby found itself wanting everyone to see the blemishes, to know what had happened - their parents, their friends, their old fans. She wanted them all to know how much of a slut she was for her sister's cock.</p><p>Dia refused to let out, her heart racing and breathing ragged as she kept going without slowing down. Her body wasn't in the peak of physical condition, but she wasn't going to stop fucking Ruby. Dia was going to pound her into the bed until a permanent imprint was left in her formerly-innocent, soiled sheets.</p><p>Without thinking, Ruby’s hands gripped Dia's backside, nails digging paths into Dia's pristine, supple skin. It seemed only right to show Dia her feelings, but unlike Dia, she was too weak to speak or even to grind back, not when she was being fucked so mercilessly. All she could do was whisper "I love you, Onee-chan" as she tried not to let her eyes linger on the stuffed animals and idol posters all around them.</p><p>Dia was too far gone for even that, having lost the ability to see straight. She was staring straight into Ruby's eyes, able to see her little sister bucking and crying beneath her. She saw Ruby’s tiny body bouncing beneath her, but she also was staring right through it. In that moment, it was all about the feeling: the feeling of Ruby's skin beneath her hands and tongue, how tight Ruby’s pussy was wrapped around her cock. The sounds she let out of her throat were animalistic, certainly not human. This wasn't the normal, strict Dia that everybody knew. This was a different Dia: one that only Ruby had now seen. In return, Dia saw Ruby in a new light as well: as a young woman, with needs that could only be described as slutty. That Ruby was slutty for <em>her</em> was very nearly overwhelming.</p><p>By now it was hard to take any more, and the devotion they shared for one another was reaching a fever pitch. The creature that had possessed Dia was driving Ruby wild, filling her little head with ideas that she was being breeded and claimed. After all, she knew she was supposed to be a good girl for Dia. Good girls let their sisters do whatever they want to, didn’t they?</p><p>Between moans and cries, Ruby finally spoke. "I'm- I'm on birth control," she said. "You can finish inside me, Onee-chan."</p><p>Dia didn't respond, at least not like the prim, proper sister she usually was. The best she could offer now was a low growl. Those words had been like a shot between the eyes, making her realize that she really was going to cum inside Ruby, whether or not she was on the pill. In fact, it barely crossed her mind then that she wasn't wearing a condom. She'd gotten so into it that she hadn't even thought to wear one. She hadn't come home expecting to bareback her sister, yet alone anything close, but there they were. She wanted to question Ruby’s use of birth control, but after a few more thrusts, that concern was the furthest thing from her mind.</p><p>All the lights seemed to be blinking as Dia came, her body tensing up to the point where she wasn't even thrusting anymore. Her body pressed down on Ruby's, pinning her to the bed and giving her no means of escape. Not that Dia was very strong, but Ruby was even weaker than her sister. Her cock was as far inside Ruby as it could go as she emptied her balls inside her little sister's waiting, willing cunt. Even if it was wrong, it was heaven, and that was all that mattered to either of them. Dia didn't even think about pulling out, not now.</p><p>Ruby looked Dia in the eyes as she felt warmth pool up in her womb, trying to convey the love she felt. She was being bred full of Dia’s cum, and it made her happy. With Dia bearing down on her, their breasts pressed flush and her thick cock pulsating inside Ruby, all she could do was lie there and take it all. As Dia emptied into her, Ruby peppered kisses all over - Dia's lips, her face, her neck. Anywhere that she could show her devotion, she eagerly did so.</p><p>Only when she felt Dia finish did they untangle themselves, Ruby’s hands and legs falling to the bed in a fit of exhaustion. Dia remained tense for longer after finishing, but gave in as well. Pressed against Ruby's body, she didn't have anywhere to fall when she finally unwound. Her arms and legs flopped against the bed, her head lolling on Ruby's shoulder. Her breathing was heavy, as if she'd had to go through one of Kanan's early morning tortures disguised as an exercise routine. The room was silent except for their gasps for breath and the quiet hum of the heater, and Ruby was content to stare lovingly at her sister.</p><p>With their chests pressed together, Ruby could feel Dia’s heart hammering against her ribcage. It all felt so good, even though it was wrong. As full of denial as Dia tended to be, even she knew better than to say that what they had done was anything less than utterly euphoric. So she chose to remain silent, struggling to catch her breath from her incredible exertion.</p><p>Ruby was the one who finally summoned the energy to wrap her arms around Dia, hugging her sister tight. "Did you like that, Onee-chan?"</p><p>For the moment, Dia just nodded, not trusting her voice to speak the truth properly. She slowly pulled out of Ruby, whimpering quietly at her sensitive, flaccid cock dragging against Ruby's walls. Ruby, too, couldn't help but whimper at the sensation, still sensitive from the number that had been done on her.</p><p>"I really loved it," Ruby added under her breath. "I love what you do to me."</p><p>With a grunt, Dia pushed herself across Ruby's body, flopping down on her back next to her sister. It was a tight squeeze on a bed that was really made for one person. They were still very close together: their arms pressing against each other, one of Dia's legs slung over Ruby's. Their bodies were heated and coated with sweat, and Dia wished she could turn a fan on.</p><p>"Yes," she finally managed to pant out, staring at the ceiling. "You did a wonderful job, Ruby. I..." She was coming down from that incredible high, which meant there was room for guilt and unease to fill in the empty spaces. Still, she had enough of that lust left to say what was undeniably true. "I love doing those things to you."</p><p>Ruby smiled softly, and as she turned onto her side to face Dia, a thumb brushed Dia's cheek softly. She knew she should go clean up, but she couldn't bear to part from her sister's side. Dia blushed slightly at such a gentle touch. It felt romantic, as opposed to the voracious sexual appetite the two of them had mere moments ago.</p><p>"I- I'm glad you don't regret it," Ruby whispered. Her smile melted into an expression that wasn't quite sad, but unsure. "I know it's selfish, but... I want to have you all to myself. Like when we were younger. When I saw that you wanted me, it made me so happy. I... know that makes me bad."</p><p>Dia quickly started to frown when she saw that unsure expression on Ruby's face. "Don't say that, Ruby." Despite her exhaustion, her tone still came out more strictly than she had meant it to. "You shouldn't feel selfish. I let it happen, so..." She sighed, pressing her forehead against Ruby's. "I liked it, Ruby. I really did. I didn't expect it to happen, but... when it was, I couldn't stop. I wanted to... mark you as my territory." She blushed deeper at such words coming from her mouth.</p><p>Ruby couldn't help but feel her heart flutter at the weight with which Dia spoke. It was a quick motion to lock her lips with Dia's yet again, and she allowed her hands to roam Dia's body without their feverish pace from before.</p><p>Dia sighed and closed her eyes, feeling a sense of peace washing over her as they kissed and touched each other again. It didn't feel like they had done anything wrong, not when everything felt calming. She didn't feel like getting up: not to clean up, get dressed, unpack... anything. All she wanted to do was lie there in bed with Ruby, whose hands felt so soft against her skin.</p><p>Dia sighed and moaned when her sister's fingers brushed across her breasts, letting out a noise of surprise when they were grabbed gently before Ruby’s hands glided elsewhere. That was the kind of boldness she still had trouble believing came from Ruby. </p><p>Touches could only speak so much, though, and Ruby let the kiss linger before pulling away slightly, just enough to speak. "It's so sexy when you make me yours," she spoke, and for effect she brought Dia's hand to her neck to rub the patchwork of bruises, their colors staining Ruby's pristine skin. "I can't get enough of it."</p><p>"You can't, huh?" Dia blushed when she opened her eyes and saw the blemishes. She had really done a number on her sister, and she hadn't even been thinking when she did it. There was going to be a lot of explaining to do should those be discovered. "You might want to cover those up before our parents get home, though." Not that either of them were interested in getting out of bed and doing the work.</p><p>"Mmn," Ruby wordlessly concurred. Some twisted part of her wanted to be caught off guard by their arrival and not be able to cover them up, but this had to come to an end... for the time being, at least. "You're probably right. Can we just stay here a little bit longer? I just got my sister back, so it's only fair," she added with a hint of playfulness. She put on her best puppy dog eyes as she looked at Dia. Even if she needed to clean up, it was hard to pull herself away from her sister's embrace, and she knew how hard it would be to keep to herself once their parents were home. Right now, though, she could do whatever she wanted, safe from prying eyes.</p><p>"Yes," Dia murmured, feeling a similar way to Ruby. She knew it was best to be ready well in advance of their parents' return, but she didn't have the strength to get up. Ruby's warmth was overbearing, yet it was lulling her into a sense of deep calm. They were still alone, and that wouldn't change for a bit longer. Perhaps it would be alright to just relax, just for the moment.</p>
