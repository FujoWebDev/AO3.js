          <div class="userstuff"><p>Anders hated the wounded coast. It was dusty, full of Tal-Vashoth who seemed to enjoy trying to kill him personally, and the uneven, winding paths were hell on his knees. And yet he'd let Hawke convince him to come out here again to chase down a bloody templar of all things.</p><p>And as if that wasn't bad enough, he'd not only had to help defend said templar from an army of demons, but now he was knelt in the dirt, ignoring the ache in his knees and trying to argue with  the idiot of a templar who refused to be healed.</p><p>"I'm fine." The man in question—a Knight Captain, no less—was currently seated in front of Anders, bleeding heavily from a gash in his side and staring at Anders like <i>he</i> was the one who'd just summoned the pack of demons. "I have a potion in my pack."</p><p>"That," Anders said, pointing at the blood spilling between the templar's fingers with a look he reserved for particularly hard-headed patients, "is not something a potion can fix."</p><p>"I have two," he said, as if that would be the difference between life and death.</p><p>"Well then, that changes everything." Anders rolled his eyes and looked over at Hawke and Carver, who were currently busy bickering and trying to shake free the bits of demon clinging to the ends of their weapons. He couldn't believe he was putting this much effort into healing a bloody templar, but not much about his life had been normal or expected since Amaranthine, really. Besides, the last thing he needed was a bunch of templars thinking up new and creative ways to harass him if they somehow found out he let their Knight Captain die. He wouldn't put it past Carver or Fenris to tell them. "Would one of you please help me convince this man to let me heal him so we can all leave?"</p><p>"I have potions," the Knight Captain repeated, sounding less certain as he glanced past down at the pool of blood forming beneath him in the dirt.</p><p>Both Hawkes turned to look at him, eerily similar expressions of disbelief on their faces.</p><p>"I think you need more than a potion." Carver was the first to speak, and Anders couldn't help the twinge of annoyance he felt as the Knight Captain hesitated, seeming all-too-willing to consider the incredibly sensible advice so long as someone who wasn't a mage was saying it. Nevermind that Carver couldn't tell elfroot from spindleweed.</p><p>"Anders is a good healer. He's patched us up more than once," Hawke added, and Anders could see the Knight Captain's resistance weakening.</p><p>"I wouldn't have bothered helping save you from demons to kill you now. I have better things to do with my time." Anders ignored the man's flinch, too annoyed to waste time being considerate, and reached for his hand.</p><p>"Alright." The Knight Captain's voice was weak as he let Anders pull it away from his side, revealing damaged armor and the nasty-looking wound beneath.</p><p>"Thank you," Anders said, more out of habit than any true sense of gratitude. He pushed aside his irritation and focused on the job before him, prodding at the edges of the wound with both his magic and his fingertips to assess the damage. Bad, but nothing he couldn't fix. He took a deep breath and closed his eyes, whispering a few hushed words and letting the cool rush of healing magic flow from his fingertips.</p><p>The Knight Captain's muscles were rigid beneath his touch, his breathing shallow. Anders let his magic spread outwards slowly, following the paths that the flesh beneath his fingertips left open, careful not to force it. His magic spread gently along the other man's skin, and Anders let it, waiting for him to relax. It took longer than he expected, almost as if the other was fighting it, but it took eventually, and Anders let the magic pour from him and into the Knight Captain.</p><p>He lost himself a bit in the process, as he always did, attention focused fully on using his magic to solve the puzzle of the broken flesh set out before him. It was always tiring, but something about it was freeing, too.</p><p>He opened his eyes, hand shaking a little as he pulled it away. He'd need sleep tonight, if he was going to be recovered enough to handle the demands of the clinic in the morning. "There. All better."</p><p>The Knight Captain stared at him, expression almost sheepish, and cleared his throat. There was gratitude and a hint of surprise in his voice as he spoke. "Thank you."</p><p>Anders shrugged, wiping the blood from his hands onto his robe as he stood. "Try not to run into any more demons on the way home. Wouldn't want you to undo all my hard work."</p><p>"Hopefully those are the last demons I'll see today."</p><p>"I think we can all hope that." Hawke laughed and clapped Anders on the shoulder. "I'm sure we'll see you in the Gallows, then, Cullen. Nice meeting you."</p><p>"I look forward to it." The Knight Captain stood, adjusting his armor and looking like there was something more he wanted to say before he pursed his lips and turned on his heel, marching down the path ahead of them.</p><center>
  <p>--</p>
</center><p>It was supper time and someone was knocking on his clinic door.</p><p>Anders reluctantly placed his half-eaten meal on the rickety table beside his bed, giving it a wistful look. He wished, not for the first time, that everyone could avoid getting hurt or becoming ill enough to need his assistance between the hours of dusk and dawn.</p><p>"Just a moment," he called out as he neared the door, unlatching it before he pulled it open. He put on his blandest expression on the off-chance the person on the other side was a mother with a poorly child and <i>not</i> Hawke with yet another excuse about why he kept getting stabbed by disgruntled Carta members. "How can I help—oh."</p><p>The Knight Captain had the grace to look somewhat embarrassed as he stood there, the ridiculous, fur-collared cloak and plain shirt and trousers that he was wearing doing a poor job of hiding the obviously military set of his shoulders. Even out of armor, he couldn't have been mistaken as anything other than a templar. "Good evening."</p><p>Anders narrowed his eyes, glancing behind Cullen. Templars didn't usually bother with subtlety, and the Knight Captain struck him as less subtle than most, but he couldn't think of a reason why Cullen would be here at his clinic that didn't involve ambushing him and dragging him back to the Gallows. "Why are you here?"</p><p>"I'm alone." Cullen seemed to notice the nervous way Anders was scanning the darkness behind him and took a step back, giving him a moment to make sure they were truly alone before he continued,"I came to ask for your assistance."</p><p>"My assistance."</p><p>"Yes." He hesitated a moment, taking his own glance around before he leaned forward. "I need healing."</p><p>"The last I checked, they had healers aplenty in the circle."</p><p>Cullen nodded, back straightening and expression hardening into something that Anders imagined he usually reserved for hard-headed recruits. Or maybe particularly surly members of the public. It would have been intimidating, if not for the obvious red of his cheeks. "I'd rather you helped me than anyone in the circle. I can provide payment, if that's an issue."</p><p>If Anders were smart, he would have shut the door in his face, returned to his rapidly cooling supper, and never thought about it again. But he'd always been more curious than wise, so instead, he opened the door wider and gestured for Cullen to step inside. "Come on, then."</p><p>Surprise flickered across Cullen's face before he accepted the invitation, slipping past Anders and stopping a few paces beyond the door, his back still rigid. Anders shut and latched the door behind him, moving a bit more slowly than was strictly necessary and letting the man sweat a little while he tried to decide why a bloody Knight Captain would be seeking his services. It wasn't as though he'd been eager to accept them before, and this time he didn't appear to be grievously wounded.</p><p>An ill-advised night at The Blooming Rose, maybe? Easier to have someone who spent his days lurking in Darktown have that information than people that he might see everyday. "What type of healing do you need, exactly?"</p><p>Something about Anders's tone must have betrayed his thoughts; the red in Cullen's cheeks darkened. "I think it might be easiest to show you."</p><p>Anders crossed his arms over his chest, thinking maybe he'd been right as Cullen unclasped his cloak and let it fall to the floor.</p><p>Cullen didn't reach for his trousers as expected, though. Instead, he lifted the hem of his shirt, revealing a large burn curving from his back onto his side and across most of his stomach. The skin was a blistered, angry red in places and a dull grey in others; it was a color he'd seen all-too-many times before with patients that tried poultices and potions where only a healer would do.</p><p>"Andraste's breath. How long have you had this?" Anders was a bit surprised at the level of anger in his voice as he leaned in to get a better look. It was hard not to be angry when anyone was this stubborn about taking care of themself, though. Even if they were a bloody templar.</p><p>Cullen had the decency to look guilty. "Not quite a week."</p><p>"Not quite a week." Anders didn't bother hiding the fury in his voice, his fingers reaching out to probe the edges of the burn. "Do you know how much easier this would have been to heal if you'd seen someone after it happened? Instead you've mucked about and made things worse for both of us."</p><p>Cullen nodded, wincing as Anders fingertips grazed a patch of blistered skin.</p><p>Anders finished his initial examination and stood back, crossing his arms over his chest. "Then why did you wait? Are the circle healers really so incompetent that you had to turn to whatever poultice you could pick up in the market instead?"</p><p>"No." Cullen swallowed, mouth opening and closing as he searched for the right words.</p><p>Anders watched him, not making any effort to hide his anger, and waited.</p><p>"I don't feel comfortable letting anyone use healing magic on me since—," he stopped, squared his shoulders, and continued, "since I came to Kirkwall. You're the only person who has."</p><p>"And now you want me to do it again? You barely let me the last time."</p><p>"...yes."</p><p>Anders frowned. "Why?"</p><p>Cullen licked his lips, voice just above a whisper. "You didn't hurt me."</p><p>Any biting remark Anders might have made died at that, and he stood there in silence, not quite knowing what to say. He'd expected the usual templar overly stoic drivel, not <i>that</i>. It was as good as an admission of weakness, and templars didn't show weakness around mages. Especially not Knight Captains living in bloody Kirkwall.</p><p>Magic meant for healing wasn't always pleasant, he knew. Even skilled healers who cared about preventing as much pain as possible couldn't totally remove all pain from the process, and far too many healers were neither skilled nor caring. But something in Cullen's voice hinted at something different, something deeper that Anders wasn't sure he wanted to know.</p><p>He brushed the thought aside and shook his head, gesturing to one of the lopsided cots across the room. He didn't want to know, and he doubted Cullen wanted to share. And if the other had taken the time to secret himself to Darktown in the evening hours and interrupt Anders's supper, then he supposed he ought to help. "Have a seat. I'll see what I can do."</p><p>Cullen hid his surprise poorly as he moved to take a seat. "Thank you. I meant it when I said I could pay you for your services."</p><p>"You can repay me by avoiding the market stalls and getting yourself properly patched up the next time this happens," Anders said, his touch more gentle than his voice was capable of at the moment. The embarrassment on the Knight Captain's face made Anders hope that he might actually listen.</p><p>By the time Anders finished, Cullen was as healed as magic could manage to make him, and Anders's supper was so cold it was very nearly inedible.</p><center>
  <p>--</p>
</center><p>"Got a delivery for ya."</p><p>Anders smiled at Lirene as she strode into the clinic, setting a basket on a rickety table they'd set up in one corner for her deliveries. "Weren't you just here two days ago?"</p><p>"Three." She started pulling bottles and bandages from the basket, laying them out on the table for his inspection. "This isn't from me. Lad delivered it this morning, asked me to bring it to you."</p><p>"A lad?" Anders eyed the line of supplies, the potion bottles made of delicately colored glass, far nicer than anything you usually saw this far down. "A Fereldan?"</p><p>"No, some fancy courier. I would've thought he'd gotten proper lost trying to find some shop in high town, but he mentioned you by name." She arched an eyebrow. "You been making fancy friends, Anders?"</p><p>Anders laughed weakly and shook his head. "Not that I'm aware of. Unless Hawke managed to find a living relative who's actually still rich."</p><p>"Seems as likely as anything." Lirene grabbed the basket. "I suppose you'll have to ask him."</p><p>"I suppose I will," Anders said, staring at the row of bottles as she left.</p><center>
  <p>--</p>
</center><p>Anders may have had a few too many, if the looks Varric and Hawke were giving him were any indication. Then again, Hawke and Varric had <i>also</i> had a few too many, so it wasn't like they were a good judge of anyone's sobriety.</p><p>"--and I still have no idea who would have sent them! I've asked everyone I can think of and none of them know anyone in High Town, let alone anyone who'd bother sending me a basket full of expensive potions."</p><p>Varric spoke slowly, obviously humoring him. "Remind me why this is a problem?"</p><p>Anders slammed his tankard against the table a bit harder than intended, sloshing liquid onto the already sticky wood of the table. "Because it could be a trap! What if someone is trying to poison me? Or my patients?"</p><p>Hawke should have been too drunk to arch his eyebrow quite so masterfully. "Who would want to poison you?"</p><p>"Templars, blood mages, whatever group is running amok in the city at the moment." Anders was mildly aware at how ridiculous he sounded, but he was too drunk and too worked up to care. He hadn't even been able to bring himself to use any of the bloody supplies yet, too afraid there was something nefarious going on. Stupid, probably, but people in this city didn't make a habit of helping others out of the goodness of their hearts. People who weren't Hawke, anyway.</p><p>"This seems like a lot of work just to poison you or your patients, Blondie."</p><p>"All I'm saying is it makes as much sense as someone using resources to help an apostate run a clinic for Fereldan refugees in Darktown," Anders mumbled, finishing off his drink.</p><p>"You're forgetting one thing," Hawke said, pausing for dramatic effect. "You're friends with me. And people love helping me."</p><p>"Except for when they're trying to kill you."</p><p>"Good point. Maybe they are trying to poison you."</p><p>Varric sighed, reaching over to slide Hawke's half-full tankards away from him.</p><center>
  <p>--</p>
</center><p>Anders never did figure out where the potions came from, but he caved a few days later and started using them.</p><p>There was a cave-in in a section of sewer where a group of especially down-and-out refugees had set up camp, and the uptick in injuries meant he'd burned through his normal supplies almost a full fortnight earlier than planned. By the time he'd dealt with the more severe cases he had no more magic to give and no potions to offer for the more minor hurts. Save the possibly poisoned ones still sitting on a table in the corner.</p><p>He weighed his options longer than he should have, probably, but in the end his weariness won out over his paranoia. He opened one and took a sip of it, waiting a few minutes for something awful to happen. Instead, all he felt was a subtle warmth running through his veins, the telltale tingle of a healing potion attempting to do its work. That settled, he started handing them out, silently thanking his mystery patron.</p><p>Maybe he was wrong and there was still someone left in the city besides Hawke who did things out of the goodness of their heart.</p><center>
  <p>--</p>
</center><p>Time passed and life went on, returning to the brutal misery that passed for normal in Kirkwall. No more potions came, and Anders had almost managed to forget about the strangeness of that first delivery when a hesitant knocking on the door of the clinic interrupted his supper yet again. He sighed, thinking someday he'd manage to go a full three days without anyone interrupting his evening, and answered the door.</p><p>It was slightly less of a surprise to see the Knight Captain standing there than it had been the first there. But only slightly.</p><p>Anders opened the door fully. "Back for more healing, Knight Captain?"</p><p>Cullen nodded, looking almost as embarrassed as he had the last time. "If you're not otherwise engaged."</p><p>"Wouldn't have answered the door if I was," Anders said, motioning Cullen inside. "And if I turn you away now, you'd probably let yourself die, and Hawke seems fond of you, so I suppose I can't let that happen."</p><p>Cullen surprised Anders with a slight smile. "No, I suppose not."</p><p>Anders shut the door and gave him a long look. "So? What is it this time? One of your limbs falling off?"</p><p>"Not quite." Cullen removed his cloak, draping it carefully over a chair before he did the same with his shirt.</p><p>Anders prided himself on his professionalism as a healer, but he found himself having a brief moment where it was hard not to appreciate the view. Cullen may have been a Templar, but he wasn't exactly hard to look at, and Anders was only human. Human and a bit more lonely than he was willing to admit, even to himself.</p><p>But any enjoyment he may have gotten out of his glimpse of Cullen's objectively nice chest and arms died when he turned to reveal the bruising across his back. It was so dark that it was almost black in places, and the way that he held himself—a posture that Anders had mistaken for his usual Templar stiffness—made it clear just how much pain he was in.</p><p>Anders sucked air between his teeth and moved closer for a better look. It didn't look as old as he would have expected, given the state that Cullen had been in the last time he'd stopped to see him. That, at least, was something to be happy about. "When did this happen?"</p><p>"This morning." Cullen hissed as Anders ran his fingers across the worst of bruising. "I think one of my ribs may be broken."</p><p>"Probably more than one." Anders kept his touch gentle while he used a thread of magic to assess just how deep the damage went. "Should be easy enough to fix, though. Since you didn't wait to see me."</p><p>"Good to know."</p><p>"Lie down on your stomach."</p><p>Cullen's jaw clenched at the request, his eyes moving to the empty cot in front of him. Anders turned his back to him and moved to a nearby table, pretending to sort through supplies while he waited for Cullen to settle himself. There was a part of him who didn't know why he bothered caring about the comfort of a templar, but a larger part of him couldn't bring himself to be outright cruel to someone who'd come to him in need. Even if they were a templar.</p><p>Anders waited until Cullen was fully settled before giving up the pretense and moving to stand over him, let his hands hover above the worst of his bruising. He could see a fine tremor running through Cullen's arms as he lay there, looking like he was waiting for a blow. "Tell me if you need a break at all. Fixing your ribs might hurt."</p><p>Cullen nodded, relaxing slightly at the first hint of warmth that Anders sent across his skin. They were both quiet as Anders began to work, losing himself a little to the magic and the feel of Cullen's body slowly mending beneath his touch. He was nearly done when Cullen finally broke the silence.</p><p>"You look to be low on potions."</p><p>The sound of Cullen's voice startled him, making his magic stutter briefly. He took a breath, refocusing himself before continuing. "No more so than usual. I'm due for another delivery next week."</p><p>"And what if you run out before then?"</p><p>"I'll make do. I have magic."</p><p>Cullen shifted slightly beneath Anders's touch. "And what if you run out of magic?"</p><p>"That's what lyrium is for."</p><p>Cullen frowned. "I could send healing potions again, if you need them."</p><p>"Again?"</p><p>"I sent some after the last time I was here. You wouldn't take any payment, and it didn't feel right to offer you nothing in return for your help." The blush that spread across Cullen's cheeks and down the back of his neck was more endearing than it should have been. "I assumed you received them. Perhaps I should have found someone to bring them here directly."</p><p>Anders laughed, startling them both. "That was you? Maker's breath, of course it was."</p><p>Cullen turned, staring up at him in confusion. "Who did you think it was?"</p><p>"No idea. I thought maybe someone wanted to poison me."</p><p>"Poison you?" Cullen gave him a look that both Hawke and Varric would have been proud of. "With healing potions."</p><p>"It made sense at the time." Anders narrowed his eyes. "Now lie down and let me finish. And stop moving, lest you undo all my hard work."</p><p>Cullen did as he was told, lying silent until he seemed unable to hold it in anymore. "Next time I'll be sure to include a note that says they're not poisoned. So you can be sure."</p><p>Anders glared at his back, slapping his undamaged side a bit harder than needed to indicate that he needed him to shift so he could have better access to his ribs. "Now I know why Hawke likes you."</p><p>Cullen looked not at all apologetic as he turned, but his voice was low and sincere as he spoke. "Thank you. I do appreciate your help."</p><p>"You're welcome." Anders got to work on the last bit of bruising, unable to help a slight smile. "And thank you for not poisoning me."</p><p>It was the first time Anders had heard Cullen laugh. He didn't entirely hate it.</p><center>
  <p>--</p>
</center><p>"Got another basket from that posh delivery boy for ya." Lirene's voice was chipper as she laid the latest delivery out on the table. "This one came with a note."</p><p>Anders huffed, wiping his hands on his robe before he moved to stand beside her. He plucked the note from the basket, unsurprised at the preciseness of the printing.</p><p>
  <i>I swear upon my mother's life that these are not poisoned.</i>
</p><p>"Looks like you've got an admirer." Lirene didn't bother hiding the curiosity in her voice.</p><p>Anders tucked the note in the pocket of his robe and started unpacking the basket's contents. "It does look like that, doesn't it."</p><center>
  <p>--</p>
</center><p>The next time that the Knight Captain interrupted his dinner, it was for a stab wound on the back of his thigh. The time after that, he'd managed to break four of the fingers on his dominant hand. And the time after that, he had a gash on his scalp covered in a makeshift bandage.</p><p>"How exactly are you not dead?" Anders tossed aside the bloodied bandage and got to work. "You can't have been managing all these injuries with nothing but potions. Unless you've been hurting yourself on purpose just to see me."</p><p>Cullen shook his head, muttering a quick apology when Anders moved a hand to grip his jaw, holding him still. "I haven't been in Kirkwall that long. And before that—"</p><p>"Before that?"</p><p>"Things were different." Cullen's words were clipped, the muscles in his jaw tense. He flinched away from the touch of magic against his skin, the look on his briefly face reminiscent of the one he'd worn that day on the wounded coast.</p><p>Anders pulled his magic back, giving them both a moment and waiting until Cullen relaxed before trying again. He thought about that quiet confession that Cullen had made the first time he'd come to him asking for help.</p><p>Things were more tense between them than they'd been since the beginning, but Anders focused on the work and tried not to worry about the look on Cullen's face. It wasn't as though it mattered, really. They had an arrangement, but it wasn't as though they were friends. Whatever the notes in the pocket of his robe might say otherwise.</p><p>"I was at Kinloch. Before Kirkwall."</p><p>"Really?" Anders's magic stuttered slightly. "I don't remember seeing you there."</p><p>Cullen pulled back, the look in his eyes close to panic. "You were at Kinloch?"</p><p>Anders nodded slowly, dropping his hands. He forced a light-heartedness into his voice that he didn't feel. "Since I was twelve. Well, except for all the times that I wasn't. I was a bit of an escape artist."</p><p>"Were you there when Uldred—" Cullen trailed off, panic deepening.</p><p>It took Anders a moment to make sense of what Cullen was asking. When he did, he softened his expression, dropping all pretense from his voice. "No, I left a few months before that." He'd heard about it from the Warden Commander in enough detail to understand the look in Cullen's eyes, though. "Uldred always was a bastard."</p><p>Cullen let out a breath and nodded, lowering his gaze to the floor. "You can finish. Please."</p><p>Anders laid his hand on Cullen's shoulder, giving it a gentle squeeze. He stayed like that for a long moment before he lifted his hand to continue healing him. There was still a tension in the air between them, and Anders felt himself falling into old habits and trying to push away the remaining awkwardness with words. "Did I ever tell you I had a cat?"</p><p>"...no."</p><p>That one word was all the permission he needed to let the words pour out of him, stories about Pounce and the adventures they had together. Small moments that were probably meaningless in the grand scheme of things, but that he found himself thinking of when the nights stretched out around him, dark and empty. By the time he ran out of stories, Cullen's scalp was fully healed and his limbs felt heavier than they should have for the amount of magic the healing required.</p><p>"There. Good as new."</p><p>Cullen's hand around his wrist was warm and surprisingly gentle, his fingertips calloused in the way of someone who spent the majority of their life wielding a sword. Anders had a moment of shock when he realized it was the first time Cullen had ever touched him.</p><p>"Thank you." Cullen's eyes were still haunted, but in a way that was more distant, the memory of whatever hurt was behind it less immediate.</p><p>"Of course. Anytime." Anders turned his wrist in Cullen's grasp, wrapping his hand around Cullen's and giving it a brief, gentle squeeze.</p><p>He stared at the door for a long time after Cullen left, not letting himself think about how well their hands fit together.</p><center>
  <p>--</p>
</center><p>The next basket came a week later, bearing potions and another unsigned note that read,</p><p>
  <i>I swear on my mother's life that these are still not poisoned.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Thank you.</i>
</p><p>Anders put that note in the pocket of his robe alongside the first and unpacked the potions, trying not to remember the curl of calloused fingers around his wrist.</p><center>
  <p>--</p>
</center><p>Seeing Cullen in the Gallows was stranger than it should have been. Anders generally avoided the Gallows like the plague and Hawke usually obliged him, bringing along someone who was less likely to be taken away in irons if he looked at one of the many templars swarming the place wrong.</p><p>But this time he hadn't protested when Hawke started leading them this way, and now here he was, skulking in the shadows behind Varric and trying not to be too obvious about the way he was watching the young Knight Captain. For his part, Cullen either hadn't noticed him or was doing a very good job of pretending as much, his attention focused fully on his conversation with Hawke.</p><p>He looked every inch the Knight Captain, his posture stiff and unforgiving, his expression leaving no room for doubt or humor. He looked like all the templars that Anders had spent his life hating with every fiber of his being.</p><p>But he also looked like Cullen.</p><p>Anders forced himself to stop staring and tried to push away whatever it was that he was feeling. Cullen writing him a few notes didn't make him any less of a templar.</p><p>"You alright, blondie?" Varric's voice was quiet, just a little worried.</p><p>Anders appreciated the worry just as much as the distraction that conversation offered from his thoughts. "Fine. Or as fine as I can be in a place like this."</p><p>"I wouldn't worry too much about the Knight Captain. He does a good job of pretending he doesn't know anything about Hawke's <i>talents</i>, and he still owes you one for that trip you took with Hawke out to the coast."</p><p>"Yeah," Anders said, not meeting Varric's eyes. "I'm sure I have nothing to worry about."</p><center>
  <p>--</p>
</center><p>The next time that Cullen showed up at his door wasn't until after they'd returned from the Deep Roads. They'd been back a week and Anders was still unable to sleep, whispers plaguing his dreams. He opened the door too dazed to really expect anything, so when he found Cullen waiting for him, all he could do was stare.</p><p>"Are you feeling well?" Cullen was the one to ask the question, which was wrong enough to shake Anders from his stupor.</p><p>"Fine. Just a bit tired." He forced a weak smile as he motioned Cullen inside.</p><p>Cullen hesitated. "Are you sure? I can come back another day."</p><p>"No," Anders's voice was sharp, brittle around the edges. He took a breath and collected himself, shaking his head. "It might take longer than usual, but I can manage."</p><p>Cullen looked no less concerned, but he didn't argue, moving to sit on the edge of his usual cot and stripping off his cloak and shirt, revealing a bloody bandage wrapped around his bicep.</p><p>Anders started to unravel the bandage slowly, the gash beneath nasty but, for once, not so nasty that it wasn't something stitches and a few potions couldn't have helped. He could fix it easily enough, but Cullen could have just as easily found someone else to sew it up for him. He met Cullen's eyes, and Cullen stared back, expression carefully neutral.</p><p>"I was in the area when it happened, and thought I should come right away. To make it easier for you."</p><p>"Thoughtful of you." Anders should have been upset at anyone interrupting his evening with such an obvious lie. He should have been furious at someone doing it when he was still waking every night with that drumming heartbeat playing in the back of his head. But he wasn't.</p><p>He might have even been happy to see him.</p><p>Happy to see a templar. As if things couldn't get any more strange.</p><p>"Anders?"</p><p>Anders blinked and set the bloody bandage aside. "Apologies. I meant it when I said I was tired."</p><p>"Yes. I can tell." Cullen had the decency to look slightly embarrassed at his own bluntness. He cleared his throat, a forced nonchalance in his voice. "I heard you joined Hawke's expedition to the Deep Roads."</p><p>"All the way in the Gallows? Word really does get around Kirkwall, doesn't it." Anders shifted his attention to Cullen's arm. Looking him in the eyes while he talked about his recent journey, even if it was just to confirm he'd been there, felt a bit too vulnerable.</p><p>"It does." Cullen cleared his throat awkwardly. "I'm glad to see you returned safely."</p><p>If Anders's voice wavered a little when he answered, at least they were the only ones there to hear it. "Me, too."</p><p>They didn't share any other words after until they were standing by the door saying their goodbyes. Cullen said his quietly and turned to leave, then turned back to Anders and reached up, hand curling around the back of his neck and squeezing gently.</p><p>Anders closed his eyes, relishing the warmth of the touch. When Cullen pulled his hand away Anders opened his eyes and offered a small, sincere smile.</p><p>"Rest well. Be kind to yourself."</p><p>"I'll try," Anders said. "Thank you."</p><p>"Anytime." Cullen smiled, sweet and sincere.</p><p>Anders thought about that smile when he laid down in his bed and the darkness felt a little bit lighter around him.</p><center>
  <p>--</p>
</center><p>The next delivery that Lirene brought him had a bottle of Fereldan wine tucked in beside the potions. The note said,</p><p>
  <i>To celebrate your return.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>As always, you can trust that it's not poisoned.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>I look forward to whatever accident will bring me your way again.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>- C</i>
</p><p>Anders traced the curl of that final letter with his thumb before he tucked the note in his pocket alongside the others. He took the wine into the back room, placing it carefully on the shelf above his bed.</p><center>
  <p>--</p>
</center><p>A week later, he finished the wine and sat down to write a note of his own.</p><p>It took him eight tries to get the words down the way he wanted, and it three rounds of drinks to convince Varric to find someone to deliver it to the Gallows, and another two drinks to convince him that the paper and ink weren't harboring any sort of magic that would kill the receiver when they opened it. But he managed eventually.</p><p>
  <i>Thank you for the wine. And for your visit. The celebration went well. Perhaps next time we can celebrate together.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>You don't only have to visit me when you're injured. Although please don't start avoiding me when you are. We'll have words if you do.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>I'd like to see you again. I hope you won't keep me waiting.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>I'd also appreciate it if you continue not to poison me.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>- A</i>
</p><center>
  <p>--</p>
</center><p>This time when Anders opened the door, he wasn't surprised to see Cullen. A bit put out about how long it had taken him to show up after Anders had sent his letter, maybe, but not surprised. Or so he told himself afterwards, when it was easier to pretend that he hadn't spent two weeks second-guessing himself and wondering if this all hadn't been some long, elaborate ruse.</p><p>Cullen looked more uncertain than Anders had ever seen him, posture almost painfully formal as he blurted out, "I received your letter requesting I visit. I'm not injured."</p><p>Anders let himself enjoy Cullen's discomfort for a long moment before he let him inside, telling himself that it was payback and not at all because the way Cullen couldn't quite look at him was in any way endearing. He shut the door behind them and leaned back against it, crossing his arms over his chest. "Took you long enough."</p><p>Cullen rubbed the back of his neck and looked away. That wasn't at all endearing, either. "I meant to come sooner."</p><p>"And why didn't you?"</p><p>"I'm not very good at this."</p><p>"This?"</p><p>Cullen looked like a nug staring down a bear, wide-eyed and like he wanted nothing more than to run as fast as his feet would carry him. "That is—friendship? Or whatever you wish this to be."</p><p>"Friendship." Anders pushed off the door, striding across the room to grab the edges of his cloak, using it to pull him closer. "Or whatever I may this may be."</p><p>Cullen stumbled forward, voice low and hopeful. "I didn't want to presume."</p><p>"You really <i>are</i> bad at this." Anders slid his hands up, cradling the sides of Cullen's face as he leaned closer. He hovered there, letting himself enjoy the closeness before he leaned in, kissing him gently.</p><p>Cullen shivered a little when they parted. "Not friendship, then."</p><p>Anders shook his head, thumbs tracing the curve of Cullen's cheeks. "Unless you regularly kiss your friends."</p><p>"Not normally, no." Cullen smiled, hands gripping Anders's hips, tugging him closer and he leaned in for another kiss. It was gentle and hungry at the same time, the warmth of Cullen's lips promising more. By the time they parted, they were both flushed and a little breathless. "I'm very glad I didn't wait to visit until I was injured."</p><p>Anders laughed. "I don't know, that could have been fun, too."</p><p>Cullen's expression as he briefly considered the possibility wasn't in the least bit endearing. "Some other time, then,"</p><p>"Some other time," Anders promised, taking Cullen's hand and leading him to his bed.</p></div>
