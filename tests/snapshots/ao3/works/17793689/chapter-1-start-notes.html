  This fic now has a companion Wiki/Reference work (
  <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/17876780" rel="nofollow">An Encyclopedia of Thedas</a>
  ) that goes more in-depth with world building/lore than I could go in the fic, which receives semi-regular updates. Updates are mentioned at the beginning of chapters of this work as they are completed.
