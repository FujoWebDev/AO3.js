<h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
<p>The College of Enchanters: New Haven was one block south of the Old Chantry which still stood in the center of a sprawling metropolis. It was difficult to believe, looking at New Haven, that in the time of the Fifth Blight, it was the site of a dragon-worshipping cult, and that at the time of the Second Inquisition just ten years later, the town had been all but destroyed by an avalanche set off in a last ditch effort to kill Corypheus and his blighted dragon. At the moment before the avalanche hit, the Second Inquisitor (a distant relative, Fenina was happy to report) had managed to snatch the orb of Fen&apos;Harel from the crazed Magister before escaping.</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, Fen&apos;Harel and his Dalish lover had torn down the Veil. The world was thrown into further chaos, as the false gods known as the Evanuris escaped their eternal prison, Void-bent on killing everyone and destroying the world just to watch it burn. It was a controversial move, one which devastated human, dwarven, and Qunari populations - but didn&apos;t obliterate them. It also helped strengthen the Elvhen (who suddenly were all capable of magic) and mages of all races, who worked in the years to come to reshape Thedas. The Evanurian War brought an end to both the Mage-Templar War and the Orlesian Civil War, as everyone realized stopping false gods was probably more important than anything else. The First Tevinter-Qunari Peace Treaty was signed as they turned their sights on the Evanuris. And that minor upstart Corypheus? The Evanuris slaughtered him first.</p>
<p>If the fall of the Veil was the single most important event responsible for shaping modern Thedas, Fen&apos;Harel and his Lavellan lover were the most instrumental people in shaping New Haven. In the years of peace which followed the defeat of the Evanuris, reconstruction was the focus for all nations; entire settlements were rebuilt, entire governments re-established, places torn asunder by the Veil (like the Vir Dirthara) were pieced back together. The excavation to reveal the Haven Chantry was completed under the supervision of Fen&apos;Harel and the Inquisitor; the preservation of the monument commissioned by the DuRellions was completed with their blessing. As more and more people flocked to Haven, they laid out the plans for the areas which would eventually become downtown New Haven.</p>
<p>The massive stone building in which Fenina attended class was, therefore, the second oldest structure in the city. Built stone-by-stone by Fen&apos;Harel, with the help of a volunteering group of Elvhen, it was originally an Elvhen only institution. The school colors were black and red, and the mascot was, obviously, a wolf. It was said the Dread Wolf himself originally taught there and so did the Second Inquisitor, though records concerning the building&apos;s completion conflicted with the date of the Inquisitor&apos;s death. Although many Elvhen found themselves effectively immortal once the Veil fell, not all did, and the Inquisitor - weakened by the Mark which had allowed her to tear down the Veil - eventually succumbed to death.</p>
<p>It was only in the last 50 years or so that other races had been admitted to the College, and only in the last decade that Qunari were allowed. As a condition to Par Vollen being admitted as the tenth state of Thedas, the Qunari government had to agree to - at the very least - no longer sewing the mouths of their mages shut. They could still be collared - voluntarily - but Fenina wondered how many would still choose that given that the rate of possession was so low. Most loyalist Qunari would never apply to study magic, given their beliefs, but the Qunari government had sent a few to colleges as a show of good faith.&#xa0;</p>
<p>Fenina&apos;s mind was wandering wildly through history as she stepped off the Goldline train and headed for her favorite coffee shop. She should really be focused on the exam on time magic she was going to have to take, rather than her research project on the Veil and all the various historical branches she had derailed on, but unfortunately, running on a lack of sleep, she couldn&apos;t seem to focus. Her favorite coffee shop was strategically placed across the street from the College in hopes of drawing in sleep-deprived college students and maybe even Templars headed in for the night shift at the Old Chantry. It seemed to work; it was usually pretty busy.</p>
<p>She turned off her music and took the headphones out of her ears, as she stepped into the buzzing coffee shop. The smells of coffee, tea, and herbs filled the air, instantly causing her to relax. Thankfully, even though the tables and chairs were filled, the line was short. The barista smiled up at her, her chipper tone reminding Fenina a bit of Dagna - and not just because the woman was a dwarf and so was Dagna&apos;s avatar. She&apos;d asked the woman once if she&apos;d ever played Dragon Age and had received a blank stare that had her flushing and apologizing for being too much of an enthusiastic fangirl.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, Fenina. The usual?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, uh, no, Shavan, I need an extra kick today. Let&apos;s do a red eye with an extra shot and lyrium-infused whipped cream,&quot; she replied with a sigh as she handed over her reusable cup. &quot;I have an exam this morning and I cannot get my shit together.&quot;</p>
<p>
  Shavan laughed brightly, ringing up her order and immediately working on pulling the espresso. &quot;Were you up late studying or playing that game? Or did you actually meet up with
  <em>real people</em>
  ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;Well, it was Dragon Age, then studying, but the people I play with are real people,&quot; she protested. She fished into her bag producing the sovereigns to pay for her purchase. &quot;In fact, we&apos;re meeting up tomorrow.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; Shavan gasped her eyes going wide as she poured the coffee over the espresso. &quot;Is that&#x2026; safe?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Probably not,&quot; Fenina admitted, &quot;but one of our guild members was a Templar and one was a Seeker, and I&apos;m pretty sure at least four of us are mages in real life, so I&apos;m probably safe if someone turns out to be an asshole.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&apos;s the probably I&apos;m worried about,&quot; Shavan said, swirling the faintly blue-glowing whipped cream on top of her drink. She placed her lid back on and handed it to her. &quot;Good luck on the exam.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks,&quot; she said as she grabbed the cup.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, swing by tomorrow after you meet up with them, let me know no one killed you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Will do,&quot; Fenina replied.</p>
<hr>
<p>&#xa0;</p>
<p>&quot;Morning, Talan,&quot; Fenina said as she slid into the seat next to the first Qunari student to be admitted into the College of Enchanters: New Haven. They weren&apos;t friends, but they were friendly in the way that ten years of being around the same person made you friendly. He was at least a couple of years older than her, as she was an early admittance, but they had taken a lot of classes together. Since he was born in Par Vollen, under the Qun, his magical training had started late. He had just barely escaped having his mouth sewn shut but had once admitted he&apos;d been collared. He didn&apos;t like to talk about it.</p>
<p>In spite of his large size and the horns which swept back majestically adding to his height, Talan often chose to sit up front. His choice left a crater of empty seats to his sides and behind him, not so much because people avoided him (well, maybe a little of that), but because people just wanted to be able to see around him.</p>
<p>She took a sip of her coffee, feeling the instant boost of lyrium to her magical energy. Not enough to call attention to herself, but enough to bring a hum to her skin, a jolt to wake her up. Talan sniffed, his sensitive nose curling up. &quot;Lyrium again?&quot; he asked, his voice a warm baritone that seemed to rumble in his barrel-sized chest. &quot;I&apos;m not sure why you poison yourself with that stuff.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You know mages - especially Elvhen mages - aren&apos;t as sensitive to lyrium. No poisoning, no addiction,&quot; she countered.</p>
<p>Talan narrowed his eyes at her as if he didn&apos;t quite believe her, but he didn&apos;t argue. His bright cobalt eyes stood out in stark contrast to his dark gray - almost black - skin as he frowned at her. &quot;Tell me again how much it doesn&apos;t affect you in another decade, and I might believe you.&quot;</p>
<p>
  &quot;Alright,&quot; a voice came as the door to the classroom was thrown open. The voice was extremely familiar, the lilt of a Tevinter magister filling the room. She could almost hear his voice over her headset, &apos;
  <em>I&apos;m not a magister, I&apos;m an altus.</em>
  &apos; The man stepped into the classroom, tall, broad, and sculpted. His robes - not the school approved ones - were bright white, with grey and flashy navy accents. The height of fashion - but certainly not Orlesian fashion. &quot;I am Associate Professor Pavus, but you can call me Dorian if you bother to speak to me at all. Professor Melarelan is out sick today, conveniently, on the day of your exam, and I&apos;m here merely to be a body in a seat.&quot;
</p>
<p>
  He handed a stack of papers to Fenina who was watching him with wide eyes. Should she tell him? Or should she wait to surprise him tomorrow? Had they been in the same building for
  <em>years</em>
  and just not run into one another? He cleared his throat, regarding her with some amusement until she finally took the top test from the stack and handed the rest over to Talan. &quot;No, I cannot answer your questions. No, I can&apos;t explain anything on the test, even though I am well versed in the theory of time magic, and no, you may not have my number so we can meet for coffee later, as irresistible as I may be.&quot;
</p>
<p>The last statement earned a chuckle from several other students. Fenina smirked to herself, hiding it behind a sip of her coffee. He was just as insufferable in real life as he was online. He spun on his heel, leather boots audible on the stone floor, as he crossed to throw himself into the teacher&apos;s chair haphazardly. The same leather boots appeared on the desk as he lounged backward, sprawled over the furniture all long limbs and oozing sex appeal. &quot;You have the rest of the two-hour period to finish your test but may leave when it&apos;s complete. Professor Melarelan assured me it should take even the slowest of you no more than an hour, so&#x2026; chop chop, let&apos;s begin. I&apos;m an important man with important business awaiting.&quot;</p>
<p>The room filled with the sounds of rustling papers, clicking pens and scratching pencils, but eventually fell to near silence broken only by students shifting in their seats, the occasional flip of a page, or an absentminded sniffle. She glanced up at Dorian, who discretely reached for the book he&apos;d slid onto the desk when he&apos;d entered and opened it to the bookmarked page. Fenina willed herself to concentrate, taking another sip of her coffee, and began reading the questions.</p>
<p>Her next half hour was filled with equations and diagrams, explanations of magic that was inherently dangerous at best, and utterly forbidden at its worst. She detailed the proper ways to place an item in stasis, demonstrated how this would fail on a living creature, calculated the amount of power needed to slow time for herself and two others. She demonstrated why traveling back in time was virtually impossible, and why traveling forward in time could destroy the fabric of reality itself. At the end of it, as she glanced up at the clock, only half an hour had passed.</p>
<p>She was the first to finish.</p>
<p>She flipped the exam back to the beginning, looking over her work. Her lips pressed together. This was dangerous territory for her. A second look always meant over thinking, second-guessing herself until she corrected problems that weren&apos;t present, ending in a grade that was worse than it would have been if she&apos;d simply left it. With a heavy sigh, she flipped the test over on her desk. Normally, she would turn it in and escape, not allow herself to dwell, but she still wasn&apos;t sure what to do about Dorian. She could pretend she didn&apos;t recognize him and walk out the door; she could approach him and ask to speak to him in private now, but that wasn&apos;t appropriate; lastly, she could wait it out and talk to him after the exam.</p>
<p>Beside her Talan shifted, finishing up his last problem. He glanced over at her, eyes narrowing a bit as he realized she was still there. She could almost hear the question he was thinking as he stood, hesitated, and then sat again, second-guessing himself. He sighed heavily and began flipping through the packet again. Finally, he seemed to gather his strength, and he stood, crossing to the table to turn in his paper. Dorian tapped the desk and glanced up at Talan, nodding and giving him a farewell smile.</p>
<p>The next student came from behind her almost a full five minutes later, then another, and another, a small trickle that turned into a flood as more and more people finished. The line for the desk backed up, and Fenina sipped the final bit of her coffee as more and more of them threw a nervous glance in her direction as if they couldn&apos;t believe she was still there. Perhaps it was time to give up the charade she was still working.</p>
<p>The line cleared out, and then the final trickle of students. Fenina couldn&apos;t help but wonder if it was always like this; did the students leaving exams always fit a bell curve? Was there some sort of relationship between their time finishing and their grades? Or were they independent? The door clicked shut, and Fenina shifted in her seat, idly drawing on the back of her exam.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you going to turn that in since you finished forty minutes ago or is there some reason you&apos;re waiting out the full two hours?&quot; Dorian asked. She looked up at him, at the amused expression on his face, at the way his smile turned up with his mustache, and his eyebrow arched critically. &quot;Is it that you find me irresistible to look at?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ahh&#x2026; no,&quot; she blushed, sliding out of her chair, she grabbed her bag and her coffee cup, depositing her test on top of the others. &quot;I was just waiting for everyone else to be done.&quot;</p>
<p>Dorian&apos;s eyes narrowed at her as if he was trying to decipher her. &quot;You&apos;re not in any of my classes. Have we met?&quot;</p>
<p>
  Fenina grinned a bit, thankful that he recognized her voice, even if he couldn&apos;t place it. She cleared her throat, and when she spoke again, she was a bit more confident. &quot;Sort of,&quot; she replied. &quot;You know, last night, Varric was saying something about how he might have died if your walking bomb hadn&apos;t gone off at
  <em>just</em>
  the right moment.&quot;
</p>
<p>
  Narrowed eyes widened suddenly as he stood, book dropping to the floor. His eyes swept from her face down to the exam where her name -
  <em>Fenina Lavellan -</em>
  was written in her neat script. &quot;Fenina?!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;
  <em>My</em>
  Fenina?&quot;
</p>
<p>She didn&apos;t get a chance to answer him as he flew around the desk and gathered her into a hug so firm he lifted her off her feet. She squealed in delight, laughing in elation at finally meeting him. &quot;You might have to fight Sera for the right to call me that,&quot; she laughed.</p>
<p>&quot;I should have known,&quot; he exclaimed as he set her back down on her feet. &quot;I should have realized when we all discovered we were in New Haven, with you being a student, you&apos;d have to go here!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Have you been teaching here the entire time?!&quot; Fenina exclaimed, wondering how she&apos;d never seen or heard the attention-grabbing altus ever before.</p>
<p>&quot;No, no, it&#x2019;s my first semester here,&quot; he said, crossing his arms over his chest. &quot;I&apos;ve been an adjunct associate professor for the College of Enchanters for the last five years. I spent three of those years in the Free Marches, one in Orlais, and now I&apos;m here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your avatar,&quot; she said slowly, grinning broadly, &quot;is a near-perfect representation of you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, come now, nothing can match my flawless complexion and aura of exquisite taste,&quot; he joked, &quot;although the same could be said of your avatar. Lovely, but not nearly the vision you are yourself.&quot;</p>
<p>Fenina flushed brightly &quot;Flatterer,&quot; she accused. &quot;Don&apos;t stop.&quot;</p>
<p>He walked around her, taking her in, and shaking his head a bit. &quot;You&#x2026; really are&#x2026; very young, aren&apos;t you?&quot; he asked.</p>
<p>
  She shrugged. &quot;Not
  <em>so</em>
  young. I&apos;m twenty-five-&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;Hah! A mere babe!&quot; he interrupted. &quot;Especially for an elf&#x2026; you know, I wonder if everyone else was as boring and predictable as us.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; she asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, here we are, our avatars, nearly in the flesh. Do you think everyone else simply recreated themselves?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&apos;s the easiest thing, isn&apos;t it?&quot; she asked. &quot;Especially going into a new game with no inspiration.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I wouldn&apos;t know, Dragon Age is the only game like this I&apos;ve played,&quot; he answered.</p>
<p>Fenina&apos;s lips pressed together, and she blushed again, suddenly feeling very young, indeed. &quot;Well, that just made me feel like a loser,&quot; she mumbled.</p>
<p>&quot;No, it explains why you&apos;re so good, and why the rest of us merely bask in your glory,&quot; he said with a flippant wave of his hand. He glanced at his watch and winced a bit. &quot;I really should be going, I have my own tests to grade.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&apos;s fine,&quot; she said with a shrug. &quot;I have some research to work on before my next class. I just can&apos;t believe we bumped into one another like this.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was rather fortuitous,&quot; Dorian agreed, gathering up the tests and books.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey&#x2026; Bull and I are going dragon killing at 3 today if you want to meet up.&quot;</p>
<p>
  &quot;Blast, that&apos;s in the middle of my last lecture. You two have fun without me. Just know that I am
  <em>wounded</em>
  you didn&apos;t think to include me before now,&quot; he answered with a wink, and with that, he strode from the classroom leaving Fenina blinking after his retreating form.
</p>
