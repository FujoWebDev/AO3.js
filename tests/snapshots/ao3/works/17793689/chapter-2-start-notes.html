<p>Another quickly written chapter in this Modern (Future?) Thedas AU. I was taking advantage of a bit of a writer&apos;s block on my other story to throw this together. For some reason, the plot to this one is falling together pretty quickly, but I&apos;m holding off on writing more until I push through my writer&apos;s block, as this one has not had nearly the attention as the other.</p>
<p>Also, if you&apos;ve read chapter 1, there are going to be some minor edits for readability. I wrote and edited that chapter on three hours of sleep and have since noticed some things that bother me. Not huge changes, and nothing that impacts characterization or story!</p>
<p>I&apos;ve added the relationship tags for Solas/Lavellan because of history, but know that it&apos;s likely to be appropriate for the current relationships as well. We&apos;ll see.</p>
