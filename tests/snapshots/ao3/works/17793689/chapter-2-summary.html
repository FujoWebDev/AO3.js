<p>In which Fenina accidentally runs into someone from TheInquisition Guild before their appointed meeting time.</p>

  <i>Shavan laughed brightly, ringing up her order and immediately working on pulling the espresso. &quot;Were you up late studying or playing that game? Or did you actually meet up with real people?&quot;</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>&quot;Well, it was Dragon Age, then studying, but the people I play with are real people,&quot; she protested. She fished into her bag producing the sovereigns to pay for her purchase. &quot;In fact, we&apos;re meeting up tomorrow.&quot;</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>&quot;Oh,&quot; Shavan gasped her eyes going wide as she poured the coffee over the espresso. &quot;Is that&#x2026; safe?&quot;</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>&quot;Probably not,&quot; Fenina admitted, &quot;but one of our guild members was a Templar and one was a Seeker, and I&apos;m pretty sure at least four of us are mages in real life, so I&apos;m probably safe if someone turns out to be an asshole.&quot;</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>&quot;It&apos;s the probably I&apos;m worried about,&quot; Shavan said, swirling the faintly blue-glowing whipped cream on top of her drink.</i>
