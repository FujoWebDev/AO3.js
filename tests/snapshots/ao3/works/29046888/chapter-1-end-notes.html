<p>So.......... Since Hori decided to kick us while we&apos;re all down (thank you sir but also how dare you sir), let&apos;s get some found family content out of it, shall we?</p>
<p>Given I&apos;m writing along the lines of the newest chapters, I expect this to become canon-divergent fairly quickly. I&apos;m just here for the Bakusquad hurt/comfort, your honor.</p>
<p>(Also I hope the shifting timeline isn&apos;t too confusing to read! Basically everything injury-related is present timeline, anything else is a flashback.)</p>

  EDIT:
