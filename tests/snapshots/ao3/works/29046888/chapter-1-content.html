<p>
  When it&#x2019;s over, Kaminari is numb. He remembers fighting, the zap of electricity that&#x2019;s not-his, that he
  <em>makes</em>
  his &#x2013; to protect his friends, the heroes rushing into battle alongside him, the confident smile Midnight sends his way. A handful of words, resolute trust shining in her eyes, in him, in his abilities, and Kaminari
  <em>moves</em>.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Chargebolt</em>,
  she calls him because he&#x2019;s a hero, because he suddenly knows no doubt, because there&#x2019;s a job to be done and he&#x2019;s the right man to do it.
</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s the last time they will ever speak face-to-face.</p>
<p>When it&#x2019;s over, Kaminari winces at the shift of cracked ribs in his chest as he&#x2019;s pulled to his feet by some kid from 1-B. Covered in blood and grime just like he is, yet Kaminari&#x2019;s brain can&#x2019;t grasp a name for them; he can&#x2019;t process anything beyond the nothingness buzzing under his skin, the void that swirls at his core where his heart used to be. A few steps away, Ashido is sobbing into Kirishima&#x2019;s chest, and Kaminari realizes in a dull sort of way that it&#x2019;s the first time he&#x2019;s seen either of them cry like this.</p>
<p>And there&#x2019;s Sero, wide-eyed, pale-faced, staring at the far horizon like he can&#x2019;t unstick himself from the sight. A direct line of destruction connects them and the spot where the giant disappeared into the distant cityscape. Sero&#x2019;s hands are trembling.</p>
<p>Kaminari does the only thing he can think of and hugs him.</p>
<p>&#x201c;It didn&#x2019;t work.&#x201d;</p>
<p>Sero&#x2019;s words barely reach him even though they&#x2019;re whispered right by his ear. Sero doesn&#x2019;t hug Kaminari back, doesn&#x2019;t take his weight like he usually would, affection coming as easy to him as his groan-worthy puns. Like he forgot he exists, like he&#x2019;s just as lost as Kaminari is in all this.</p>
<p>
  &#x201c;It didn&#x2019;t w-work, we... We failed. They&#x2019;re headed straight for the others and we fucking
  <em>failed</em>
  them, Denki, holy shit.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>It takes everything in Kaminari to keep breathing. &#x201c;We didn&#x2019;t.&#x201d; His arms tighten around Sero and Kaminari shakes, too, has perhaps been shaking from the very start.</p>
<p>
  &#x201c;
  <em>We didn&#x2019;t.</em>
  Okay? Midnight said it&#x2019;ll work, and we trust her, right? So, this wasn&#x2019;t for nothing. We won&#x2019;t let it be for nothing.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>Sero cries then, too. Kaminari closes his eyes and holds him, his hands clinging to the back of Sero&#x2019;s tattered hero costume like it&#x2019;s the last thing between him and mindless oblivion.</p>
<p>When it&#x2019;s all finally over, Kaminari walks to where Jirou is pressing her knees to her chest with a blank look on her face. The offer of a hand up, a fleeting smile that&#x2019;s barely returned, and they&#x2019;re off &#x2013; retracing their steps, following orders from a lifetime ago to regroup with the other teams. To account for those who stood to their left and right before they charged, for those who can&#x2019;t stand anymore, those who will never stand again. Kaminari doesn&#x2019;t let Jirou go, although their palms are slippery with sweat and their laced fingers clench hard enough to hurt.</p>
<p>Jirou mutters, &#x201c;We&#x2019;re gonna be okay&#x201d;, that spark of determination there like she can make it so by spelling it out. &#x201c;You hear me, Bolt? It&#x2019;s gonna be okay.&#x201d;</p>
<p>
  None of this even feels
  <em>real</em>;
  Kaminari doesn&#x2019;t have it in him to admit to that, to shatter the reassurances he&#x2019;s able to tell everyone but himself. He just nods and keeps going.
</p>
<p>
  They get to the rendezvous point. Uraraka is there, so is Asui, and there&#x2019;s relief in seeing them &#x2013; shaken but alive, alive,
  <em>alive</em>
  &#x2013; even if Kaminari&#x2019;s gaze can only linger for a moment. His eyes roam over toppled buildings and cars thrown around like children&#x2019;s toys. Over dirt and asphalt alike clawed up by an invisible beast. Kaminari
  <em>hopes</em>
  it wasn&#x2019;t the giant but who&#x2019;s to tell? Does it even matter anymore, now that it&#x2019;s done?
</p>
<p>
  Now that it happened, and they&#x2019;re here, and the result of their every action spills from horizon to horizon, painted in shades of red and the agonized moans of people trapped, injured, dying,
  <em>dying</em>
  ?
</p>
<p>He doesn&#x2019;t know the answer to that, either, doesn&#x2019;t even know how to ask the fucking question. Not with Jirou motionless by his side, biting her lip to stop herself from whimpering as the sight overwhelms her, and the sound of Sero&#x2019;s breath hitching before he doubles over and throws up.</p>
<p>
  All Kaminari knows is that this &#x2013; this moment, this... realization, this visceral sense of
  <em>grief</em>
  that pierces through him all the way to his core, to his very bones &#x2013; will always be a part of him.
</p>
<p>That this is his future. What it means to be a hero.</p>
<p>
  Then, Kirishima steps up and calls, &#x201c;Bakugou&#x201d;, more than faint. At first, Kaminari thinks he&#x2019;s spotted him, that this nightmare will finally stop spiraling out of control because
  <em>Bakugou will know what to do</em>.
  Top of the class, always quick on his feet and possessing the strongest nerves in all of 1-A &#x2013; all of U.A., possibly. They&#x2019;re at their most invincible with Bakugou there to hone their focus, to push them forward with that unique kind of teeth-bared tenacity Kaminari has come to rely on in the past year.
</p>
<p>
  So, Kaminari looks. He follows the tentative step Kirishima takes, &#x201c;Katsuki&#x201d;, his voice so hoarse Kaminari wouldn&#x2019;t even recognize it if he weren&#x2019;t standing right next to him. &#x201c;No, no,
  <em>no</em>.
  Please, no, not him&#x201d;, a plea that goes from feeble to desperate, and Kaminari sees&#x2013;
</p>
<p>Iida, helmet off, severe face twisted with agitation as he argues with the medics on the scene. Blood, so much blood, staining the gleaming chrome of his armor up to his neck in wet, intersecting streaks of crimson.</p>
<p>And in his arms, mask torn and body limp, is Bakugou Katsuki.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Thinking back, Kaminari was curious about Bakugou long before they became friends. Curious, and more than a little put off.</p>
<p>
  Like,
  <em>come on</em>,
  the guy went after his childhood friend with his murder-y explosion hand powers on day-freaking-one, and somehow didn&#x2019;t get expelled?! Granted, he was supposed to play a villain at the time, and he might&#x2019;ve
  <em>tried</em>
  but didn&#x2019;t succeed in making their class smaller by one unit of Midoriya right off the bat... Still: Not finishing the job shouldn&#x2019;t be a factor to consider when it came to attempted manslaughter. At a
  <em>hero academy</em>,
  no less.
</p>
<p>Seriously, what the hell?</p>
<p>
  It also didn&#x2019;t help that Bakugou was smart as all fuck and wanted absolutely everyone to know it. (A crazy strong quirk
  <em>and</em>
  amazing grades to flex with? The definition of unfair!) His fuse was so short it was practically non-existent &#x2013; as much an illusive hypothetical as those cryptids from the 2000s, which was saying a lot given half of U.A.&#x2019;s student base would&#x2019;ve counted as one of those in pre-quirk society &#x2013; and oh yeah,
  <em>he hated Kaminari&#x2019;s guts</em>.
</p>
<p>
  Well, technically he hated everyone&#x2019;s guts except Kirishima&#x2019;s. Which was definitive proof that nobody, not even the grumpiest asshole Kaminari had ever met, could truly come to resent Kirishima &#x2018;Patron Saint of Manly Wholesomeness and Good Will&#x2019; Eijirou. Kaminari&#x2019;s bro was
  <em>that</em>
  awesome.
</p>
<p>There just had to be something there that made said awesome bro that fond of Bakugou, something only he got to see.</p>
<p>
  So, yeah, Kaminari was
  <em>curious</em>.
</p>
<p>
  Their collective move to Heights Alliance allowed him to catch tiny glimpses of it, eventually: How early mornings tended to smooth out Bakugou&#x2019;s typical scowl into regular just-rolled-out-of-bed grouchiness, or that a glare from those red eyes could mean anything from amusement to annoyance to genuine (if quickly concealed) apprehension. How Bakugou&#x2019;s insane attention to detail extended past academics to people&#x2019;s mundane habits, and that he&#x2019;s got a strangely sweet way of both accommodating them
  <em>and</em>
  vehemently denying that&#x2019;s what he&#x2019;s doing. The sharp-tongued one-liners Kaminari would&#x2019;ve called pointlessly harsh before turned out to be the Bakugou-equivalent of jokes, easy to spot purely by how smug he got when they made Kirishima laugh through an exasperated,
  <em>Dude, are you for real?</em>
</p>
<p>
  All in all, Bakugou&#x2019;s a chill guy to be around if one factors out a) his expansive vocabulary of insults, b) the constant threats, death or otherwise, and c) the
  <em>actual</em>
  aggression that comes with calling him out on any of it.
</p>
<p>Which means that, obviously, Kaminari does exactly that, every single time.</p>
<p>Because it works like a charm. Every. Single. Time.</p>
<p>
  The fact that Kaminari&#x2019;s hair only got mildly singed
  <em>once</em>
  would probably count as a minor miracle for some religions.
</p>
<p>
  On the arbitrary scale of friendship he references in his head to make sense of the people around him &#x2013; because Bakugou is a weirdo in a class exclusively made of weirdos, Kaminari included, thank you very much &#x2013; the guy is an unholy cross between a mom friend and some version of Dad, on
  <em>nightmare mode</em>.
  A feral sort of parent friend?
</p>
<p>In any case, someone who&#x2019;s as likely to physically drag a friend for half-assing their homework as he is to smash someone&#x2019;s face in for hurting their feelings.</p>
<p>(On one memorable occasion involving an embarrassing amount of crying on Kaminari&#x2019;s part, Bakugou had listened to the sordid tale of him asking out this dude from second year and the subsequent Disaster Date, only to point out that exact person Kaminari had sworn to avoid for the rest of his life during lunch the next day.</p>
<p>&#x201c;That him?&#x201d;, Bakugou had asked like he was considering some particularly uninteresting dirt sticking to the heel of his boot.</p>
<p>What followed Kaminari&#x2019;s dejected little nod was a brutal campaign of blizzard-level glares and smirks radiating homicidal energy so intense, the guy practically ceased to exist anywhere near them. Tearful thankyous would only serve to puff Bakugou up like the human hedgehog he is, so Kaminari did the next best thing and repaid him in cups of fresh coffee every morning for a week.)</p>
<p>It all comes to a head when the squad gathers under a starlit sky on Kirishima&#x2019;s sixteenth birthday, albeit a lovingly painted one.</p>
<p>
  It&#x2019;s barely an hour past midnight; they&#x2019;re lounging on Kirishima&#x2019;s camo-clad bed like most of &#x2018;em
  <em>aren&#x2019;t</em>
  dotted with dried paint and bits of wire. Kirishima doesn&#x2019;t seem to care either way, busy blissfully staring at his own ceiling. Next to him, Bakugou is yawning like he pulled three all-nighters in a row &#x2013; being up past 9:00 PM kinda does that to a senior citizen like him &#x2013; when he finally gives in with a muttered, &#x201c;G&#x2019;night or whatever.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Night, Blasty!&#x201d; replies the usual chorus, kept somewhat quiet in case Shouji actually managed to sleep through their earlier yelling. Kirishima watches Bakugou slink off with a fond look, turns back towards his friends and announces:</p>
<p>&#x201c;Okay, so. Baku&#x2019;s birthday.&#x201d;</p>
<p>
  Hushed as his voice is, there&#x2019;s rock-solid (hah!) determination behind those words, a glint to his eyes that calls to Kaminari&#x2019;s penchant for mischief despite the three-week mission they just concluded for
  <em>this</em>
  birthday. As in, the one they&#x2019;re still celebrating for the next twenty-three hours.
</p>
<p>Curious once more, Kaminari picks his head up and prompts: &#x201c;Baku&#x2019;s birthday?&#x201d;</p>
<p>
  From her perch on Kirishima&#x2019;s headboard Ashido asks, &#x201c;Did we miss it?&#x201d;, brows drawn in worry while her legs serve Sero as a backrest.
  <em>That</em>
  didn&#x2019;t occur to Kaminari but it definitely tracks, with Bakugou being the oldest in their class and all. He frowns at the LED stars above them.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Nah&#x201d;, goes Sero before he tilts his head. &#x201c;Well, kinda? It passed sometime in April. Midoriya was muttering about it, I remember that much.&#x201d;</p>
<p>
  &#x201c;April 20
  <sup>th</sup>,
  wasn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;, comes from a pensive Jirou, who has successfully hijacked Kirishima&#x2019;s pillow and is playing with a strand of Kaminari&#x2019;s hair. It&#x2019;s really cozy. Not at all bound to make him flustered. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the anniversary of the Freddie Mercury Tribute at Wembley.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>
  &#x201c;You mean Weed Day&#x201d;, Kaminari and Sero revise in the same breath. They crack up and knock fists. &#x201c;
  <em>Nice.</em>
  &#x201d;
</p>
<p>April seems impossibly long ago, though. Anything before the Kamino Ward Incident feels that way, really.</p>
<p>Back then, only Kirishima was anywhere close to being friends with Bakugou, and going by the somber look on his face, he wasn&#x2019;t informed of the birthday in time to do anything about it. Everyone else in the squad aside from Kirishima himself was born in Summer, so they&#x2019;d made it a thing to at least hang out together to honor each day individually.</p>
<p>
  And then Bakugou swooped in and made it
  <em>extra</em>
  for Kirishima&#x2019;s sake. Feral parent friend status: Confirmed.
</p>
<p>
  Nudging Kirishima&#x2019;s thigh with his foot, Kaminari gives him a look that hopefully spells out,
  <em>Stop beating yourself up on your own birthday.</em>
</p>
<p>It doesn&#x2019;t need much more than that to bring Kirishima&#x2019;s smile back as he leans forward.</p>
<p>
  &#x201c;Yeah, it&apos;s the 20
  <sup>th</sup>!
  There&#x2019;s still a bunch of time until then, but it&#x2019;s the next squad birthday and I&#x2019;m thinking, like, we should pull off something really manly for him, y&#x2019;know? To make up for this year&#x2019;s and all.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>There&#x2019;s a dreaminess to his voice as Kirishima glances up at his own birthday present again and his entire face goes soft, with literal stars in his eyes.</p>
<p>
  Yeah, they&#x2019;ve gone above and beyond for that one &#x2013; it&#x2019;s hard not to when it&#x2019;s for
  <em>Kirishima</em>,
  who deserves only the best things in life, and there&#x2019;s the full force of Bakugou&#x2019;s drive behind the project. It gave them all something productive to fuss over during and after Kirishima&#x2019;s hospitalization, so it&#x2019;s a win-win all around.
</p>
<p>
  Besides, seeing Bakugou dead-set on something that
  <em>isn&#x2019;t</em>
  hero-related is a rare treat in and of itself.
</p>
<p>(Like, he&#x2019;d gathered them in a bonafide war council to petition for their help! It was dramatic and so cool. Kaminari had never felt closer to being a secret agent.)</p>
<p>Calling Kirishima out on getting sappy over Bakugou is pointless; it would take until next week to account for it all. Which leaves one last thing for Kaminari to settle:</p>
<p>&#x201c;We gotta come up with the ideal birthday present for Baku!&#x201d;</p>
<p>A beat.</p>
<p>&#x201c;So... What, uh. What&#x2019;s Baku&#x2019;s ideal birthday present?&#x201d;</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>
  It&#x2019;s not like Bakugou doesn&apos;t
  <em>like</em>
  stuff. Kaminari knows he&apos;s into horror movies, death metal and anything All Might-related. (Even though the latter shall never be openly acknowledged. Bakugou tends to
  <em>mean</em>
  the gruesome scenarios he threatens over it.)
</p>
<p>Thus, all eyes go to Kirishima, who hums and scratches the back of his head. &#x201c;Uhhh, well. That&#x2019;s... Hm.&#x201d;</p>
<p>Under the weight of Ashido&#x2019;s patented Raised Eyebrow of Judgement, Kirishima sputters, a blush climbing from his neck to the roots of his hair.</p>
<p>
  &#x201c;Listen! I
  <em>just</em>
  thought of the birthday thing, okay, I haven&#x2019;t&#x2013; I just wanna make him happy, y&#x2019;know? This year&#x2019;s been tough on him and like, he keeps doing stuff for us and working so hard...&#x201d;
</p>
<p>Kaminari sits up, &#x201c;Woah there, dude&#x201d;, legs crossed and palms bared in a placating gesture. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to convince us here, we wanna see Blasty smile, too!&#x201d; Enthusiastic nods all around. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s just brainstorm until we come up with something rad, yeah? Baku had, like, a whole action plan ready to go when he asked us to chip in.&#x201d;</p>
<p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s so cool!&#x201d; Kirishima clutches at his chest like the mere notion of that physically hurts him. &#x201c;Ugh, how is he so cool?&#x201d;</p>
<p>
  A snort from Jirou. &#x201c;Pretty sure he was overthinking a good 60% of it, to be honest. Those notes were
  <em>hella</em>
  detailed.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;That perfectionist idiot&#x201d;, sighs Ashido fondly. &#x201c;Our perfectionist idiot!&#x201d;</p>
<p>
  Laughing, Kaminari finger-guns at her. &#x201c;Exactly. See? Even
  <em>Bakugou</em>
  didn&#x2019;t come up with it outta nowhere, we totally got this!&#x201d;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;So, we&#x2019;re basically aiming to beat him at his own game?&#x201d;, muses Sero with his thumb on his chin. A grin spreads on his lips, pleased in its pointiness. &#x201c;Hiding this from him for so long is gonna be a whole nightmare and a half. Let&#x2019;s do it!&#x201d;</p>
<p>&#x201c;Hell yeah!!&#x201d;</p>
<p>
  Suddenly, a solid
  <em>thump</em>
  sounds from the wall to their left. An immediate hush falls over all of them as they share a wide-eyed look. It doesn&#x2019;t take Bakugou&#x2019;s physical presence in the room for Kaminari to imagine him hissing for
  <em>some damn peace and quiet, for fuck&#x2019;s sake</em>.
</p>
<p>...Whoops?</p>
<p>
  &#x201c;Think he heard all that?&#x201d; The whispered question belongs to Ashido. It&#x2019;s followed by a giggle. &#x201c;
  <em>Guys.</em>
  Our sneaking mission didn&#x2019;t even survive the first ten seconds, oh man.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>Kirishima shakes his head with a chuckle. &#x201c;Nah, I think he just wants me to come over already. Was grumbling about the fumes having to vent first, or something along those lines. I didn&#x2019;t question it much.&#x201d;</p>
<p>Everyone blinks at him, more than dumbfounded. There&#x2019;s a lot to unpack there; Kaminari starts with the part that makes the least amount of sense to him.</p>
<p>&#x201c;Fumes? The weed thing earlier was a joke buuut like...&#x201d;</p>
<p>
  &#x201c;No! Like, from the paint?&#x201d; A finger is pointed upwards. Oh,
  <em>those</em>
  fumes. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s pretty fresh, so it has to dry properly before I sleep in here. Dunno, Bakubro thinks it&#x2019;s unhealthy, chances are he&#x2019;s right.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Huh.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s Jirou. &#x201c;Yeah, pretty solid advice, actually.&#x201d;</p>
<p>
  Given those two are the squad&#x2019;s vanguard in terms of brain cells, Jirou&#x2019;s approval seals the deal on that. Next topic, then.&#xa0;Kaminari drawls, &#x201c;A sleepover at
  <em>Katsuki&#x2019;s</em>,
  huh?&#x201d;, jabbing Kirishima&#x2019;s elbow with his own.
</p>
<p>
  &#x201c;Yeah&#x201d;, Kirishima deadpans, like he
  <em>hadn&#x2019;t</em>
  talked both of Kaminari&#x2019;s ears off the first few times it happened. From one bisexual disaster to another, there is no shame &#x2013; only suffering and the occasional pep talk.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Let me live, bro. It&#x2019;s my birthday!&#x201d;</p>
<p>Grinning, Kaminari ruffles Kirishima&#x2019;s loose hair. &#x201c;Yeah, yeah, you know I&#x2019;m just teasin&#x2019;. Get that snuggling time in, man, you deserve it.&#x201d;</p>
<p>&#x201c;Best not keep him waiting, then&#x201d;, Sero smiles, stretching his back and long arms after he gets to his feet to let Ashido up, too. &#x201c;Plus, Bakugou&#x2019;s got kind of a point &#x2013; we should catch some Z&#x2019;s. Big plans tomorrow! Today? Y&#x2019;know what I mean.&#x201d;</p>
<p>At that, Kirishima perks up. &#x201c;Plans?&#x201d;</p>
<p>&#x201c;Good night, Riot&#x201d;, sing-songs Ashido over her shoulder, already on her way out and not answering a single question Kirishima calls after her. Jirou pats Kirishima&#x2019;s shoulder, &#x201c;Sleep tight, dude&#x201d;, and gives Kaminari a little smile before joining Ashido.</p>
<p>Oh, man. Okay, cool, that... That happened.</p>
<p>
  Kaminari hopes his face isn&apos;t as red as it feels. Chances are it is, because the glance Kirishima&#x2019;s giving him is a carbon copy of the one Kaminari gave
  <em>him</em>
  two minutes ago; there&#x2019;s a knowing snicker to match from Sero, so he&#x2019;s totally an open book and
  <em>why is this my life again?</em>
</p>
<p>Kaminari groans. &#x201c;Look, guys, I&#x2019;m workin&#x2019; on it. What else can I say?&#x201d;</p>
<p>Regardless, he lets himself get pulled outside and manages to keep his whining on the down-low while they bid Kirishima goodnight. Maybe while they figure out a present worthy of the King of Explodo-Kills, a solution for the Jirou-crush-situation will come to Kaminari, too.</p>
<p>A man can always dream.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>
  When it&#x2019;s all finally, irreversibly
  <em>over</em>,
  Kaminari sits in the waiting room at Central Hospital. Elbows on his knees, he stares at the hands loosely linked between them, lacking any sort of tension. Bruised. There&#x2019;s dirt clinging to the creases of the joints, along the edges of the nails and under them, too.
</p>
<p>They&#x2019;re his hands. The dirt is his to deal with, as is the ache that refuses to fade even hours later. Kaminari wonders if it ever will.</p>
<p>Later, he will flag down a nurse to check on his ribs, ask for some painkillers, if it&#x2019;s not too much trouble. Perhaps when the influx of new patients slows for the night &#x2013; heroes, civilians, villains, it&#x2019;s all the same where life and death dance on a knife&#x2019;s edge &#x2013; and the rush of medical personnel all around him has dulled to background noise. Soothing.</p>
<p>Kirishima has long lost the fight against his exhaustion. The even puffs of air he breathes against Kaminari&#x2019;s shoulder are a welcome change to the panicky gasps from before, when the possibility of Bakugou not making it out of emergency surgery alive had finally sunken in. A miracle, the doctor had said, that&#x2019;s what it would take for him to pull through the night. To have a fighting chance at recovery, however that may look like.</p>
<p>
  Kaminari is clueless about a great many things, he&#x2019;s the first to admit that. He knows Bakugou has fought bad odds before, hell, he
  <em>flipped off</em>
  those bad odds and turned them into a source of strength instead. He
  <em>knows</em>
  betting on a miracle is a stupid thing to do.

<p>What else is there, though? What else?</p>
<p>On his other side, Jirou is curled up with her head on both their busted jackets, bundled up and propped against Kaminari&#x2019;s hip. Sero somehow managed to squeeze his lankiness in-between Kirishima and Ashido, snoring quietly on Ashido&#x2019;s lap with her hand tangled in his hair.</p>
<p>Nobody is awake but him; Kaminari&#x2019;s okay with that. Sleep won&#x2019;t come easy for some time, possibly forever, he knows that too.</p>
<p>His vision blurs, then. Kaminari lets the tears spill, too tired to keep pushing them down. It&#x2019;s fine to cry now, right? He can break if it&#x2019;s for a little while, just long enough to get it out of his system and keep going. His shoulders shake, his dirty-bruised hands grasping each other tightly, twisting together to pull some of that ache out of him, make it real enough to ground him.</p>
<p>Yeah. Just for a bit, then he&#x2019;ll get those painkillers and see if there&#x2019;s a konbini nearby to grab some dinner for everyone. Breakfast? Some form of food. In the meantime, there will be a call to the Bakugous to make, some classmates to check up on. Kaminari&#x2019;s phone is pitifully close to tapping out &#x2013; sniffling, he wipes at his face before he grabs it to force it back to life. Even that low a voltage makes his skin prickle with overstimulation. It&#x2019;s no big deal. It won&#x2019;t take long.</p>
<p>The war is over yet Kaminari refuses to let any of this go. Because Bakugou is facing death again but he&#x2019;s not doing it alone, this time around. They will see this through no matter what awaits them at the end of the long night ahead, and the morning after, and the day after that.</p>
<p>They&#x2019;ve already made plans for Bakugou&#x2019;s birthday, after all.</p>
