<p>In death, when it finally comes for her, Cassandra knows she will not atone for the life she took those years ago. Her life spent in penance was exchange enough, her lives lost those few times before too having absorbed that guilt in full.</p>
<p>Cassandra is tired of living for others. That she barely knows how to live for herself, that the people she lives for is all she has&#x2014; that much is true.</p>
<p>
  But... Batman, Oracle, Robin, Stephanie&#x2014;
  <em>Steph</em>
  &#x2014; they had all left her, in one way or another.
</p>
<p>
  Whenever he would inject in her the daily dose needed to remain in his clutches, there would always be that comfortable sense of slipping under the warm waves. In this hotel bed now, his daughter by her side...
  <em>Rose</em>,
  more than his daughter, so much more than the Titans took her for before she ran off with nothing but the clothes on her back and Cassandra on her motorcycle...
</p>
<p>
  (
  <i>I don&apos;t know where you end and I begin</i>,
  she had once told Batman.
</p>
<p>
  She had never meant
  <em>him</em>
  in particular, of course, as she slid her hand down the symbol on his chest, but she had since figured that he took it to mean himself.
</p>
<p>He praised her for those words, and a year later, he left with Robin and Nightwing in tow and left her to the wolves.</p>
<p>That&apos;s fine. It was always fine. Cassandra knew best how to fend among the wolves over the bats.)</p>
<p>...For a while, she would miss those waves, the feeling of sinking under, succumbing to the loss of will.</p>
<p>Cassandra feels her eyes widen at that thought, her breath seizing in the cool draft passing through the slit between the window and the wall.</p>
<p>Rose stirs beside her, none the wiser. Cassandra doesn&apos;t turn to face her, keeps her gaze fixed on the wall across from her. She squeezes her eyes shut tight.</p>
<p>Maybe with Rose by her side, she can learn how to move on from here; she&apos;ll trace her dreams in the night sky&apos;s constellations while laid across the roof of stolen cars, find Rose in each and every one of them, the shadows of lives long dead and gone echoed behind them.</p>
<p>
  Maybe... maybe she will be able to
  <em>live</em>,
  finally, in spite of her coming death, rather than in
  <em>service</em>
  of it.
</p>
<p>(Later, Rose will startle awake from a nightmare she won&apos;t talk about. Later, Cassandra will turn around and face the woman that shares her bed, tell her how she can&apos;t sleep.</p>
<p>And later, after scaling the sides of buildings and hopping rooftops, both each weighed down by the long shadows they cast, but springs in their steps and jumps as they leap to the next...</p>
<p>There isn&apos;t much she will do in the moment, then. But Rose will look at her with a soft, knowing smile, sincere and bittersweet, and Cassandra will return the smile and feel the hands on her shoulders lift off ever so gently.)</p>
